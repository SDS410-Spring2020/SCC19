          The honor of your participation is requested at
The 142nd Commencement of Smith College: A Virtual Celebration
Sunday, May 17, 2020
Noon, EDT

Please respond at smith.edu/commencement by April 29, 2020.

To the Smith College Class of 2020:

You deserve a celebration—in fact, more than one.

On Sunday, May 17, we will come together to honor your achievements at the first virtual Commencement in the history of Smith College. Although extraordinary circumstances prevent us from gathering in person this year, they will not preclude the rightful recognition of your accomplishments. Extraordinary circumstances require an extraordinary celebration, and so it shall be. The Smith community will cheer with pride from every corner of the world.

While virtual, this ceremony will be personal. Your name will be read aloud, accompanied by a photo of your choice. Your friends and family can watch together and send greetings. You will hear from me, Senior Class President Toula Sierros ’20, Student Government Association President Rosalie Toupin ’20—and, yes, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, who is delighted to address the great class of 2020.

In advance of the ceremony, you will receive two Smith-themed gifts from me. They are small but tangible reminders of your lifelong connection to this college and to one another. Following the ceremony, we will mail you your diploma and a commemorative Commencement program. And sometime next year, when conditions permit,  I look forward to welcoming you back to Smith to celebrate in person. I want to make sure you have the chance to spend time with one another, on this beautiful campus, enjoying traditions you missed.

I will close with words of wisdom from a Smith alumna, one of many who have sent heartfelt messages of support to your class in this challenging moment:

Although this is not the idyllic end to your time at Smith, know that in fact there is no end to your time at Smith. Take comfort in knowing that the knowledge you have gained, and the people with whom you have bonded, will remain there for you. Welcome to the next phase of your life as a Smithie, as part of a network of incredible alumnae who cannot wait to receive you with open arms and hearts.

Class of 2020, you are making history, albeit in ways you would not have chosen. We look forward to celebrating your resilience and leadership—with open arms and hearts.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          Dear students, staff and faculty:

It is my pleasure to announce the appointment of Baishakhi Taylor, vice president for student affairs and dean of students at Middlebury College, as Smith’s next dean of the college and vice president for campus life beginning July 1, 2020.

In her new role, Baishakhi will serve as a member of the President’s Cabinet and oversee a variety of offices that work collaboratively to ensure students are successful during their time at Smith. Specifically, she will have responsibility for academic advising, international students, student affairs, residential life, student engagement, health and counseling services, athletics, career services and disability services. She will also oversee several centers, including the Jandon Center for Community Engagement, the Lazarus Center for Career Development, the Lewis Global Studies Center, and the Wurtele Center for Leadership.

In her current role at Middlebury, Baishakhi oversees residential life, judicial affairs, health and wellness education, student activities, orientation and spiritual and religious life. She is also an assistant professor in gender, sexuality and feminist studies and a faculty mentor for Middlebury’s BOLD Women’s Leadership Program. During her tenure at Middlebury, Taylor co-led the Alliance for Inclusive Middlebury, a presidential committee charged with developing a strategic plan for making inclusion a priority for the institution.

Baishakhi is a strategic leader and program builder with a passion for working with students. Her commitment to inclusion and her scholarship on gender, sexuality and feminist studies are clearly aligned with Smith’s core values, and I look forward to welcoming her to our community in July.

I would like to close by extending my thanks to the search committee—Nalini Bhushan, Floyd Cheung, Samantha Earp, Katie McGarry ’21, Melisa Aguila Rua ’21, Michael Thurston, Tina Wildhagen and Will Williams. 

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          Dear All,

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt throughout the world—life as we know it changed dramatically during the past several weeks. So much outstanding work has occurred on campus in response to this crisis. Our facilities and residence life staff worked hard to quickly move nearly all of our students off-campus. The international study team brought home more than 200 students from study abroad programs throughout the world. And despite the formidable challenges, the Smith faculty, with tremendous support from key staff, especially in information technology, are now teaching remotely. Early reports are that students and faculty are adapting well and that the quality of teaching remains high. We could not be more proud of the can-do spirit of our community.

As we all know from the news, the COVID-19 crisis has had a dramatic impact on the global economy. The stock market has been quite volatile and trending downward, while unemployment has skyrocketed. This economic downturn will affect Smith in many ways.

Consider that the college’s budget is largely driven by three funding sources:

The endowment: When the market goes down, so does our annual payout, which funds approximately 35% of our $240M annual budget. The college’s endowment has lost considerable value due to the pandemic. Our key benchmark is down 17% for the fiscal year through the end of March.
	Philanthropy: Prior to COVID-19, we were having a strong year, thanks to the generosity of our alumnae; however, philanthropic giving generally declines during economic downturn.
	Tuition, room and board: This will remain stable if we successfully recruit an incoming class and if our rising sophomores, juniors and seniors return to Smith in the fall. Further, it is too early to know whether our international students will be able to obtain visas in light of travel restrictions or whether financial aid needs will increase, given that some parents have lost their jobs. Many uncertainties remain; however, it is likely that this funding source, our largest, will decline.
Fortunately, Smith College is in a strong financial position, and we should take heart in this. There are three reasons for our financial strength. First, we have a large endowment compared with most colleges. Second, we have built up cash reserves to help address shortfalls during tough times like these. Finally, we will benefit from the financial sustainability work we have undertaken during the past four years.

The operating budget for the current fiscal year, ending on June 30, has already experienced an $8M to $10M hit from lost revenue and unanticipated expenses. This is primarily because we are refunding a sizable share of room and board fees to students who have returned home. We expect to receive some support from the federal government, maybe as much as $2M, and we have cash reserves to cover a portion of the gap this year. The question we must ask ourselves is, how do we prepare for an uncertain future, when there are so many unknowns?

Given the economic context, we have decided to take some actions now.

We are implementing a faculty and staff hiring freeze. Any future hiring will be limited to a small number of essential positions. The Office of the Provost is in the middle of its hiring cycle and will work with departments to protect curricular priorities.
	We are restricting departmental spending to costs associated with academic and business continuity. The budget office will work with cabinet members and departments to provide further guidance.
	We are asking departments with restricted gifts and endowments to utilize those funds as much as possible. Again, the budget office will work with departments.
Going forward, we must hope for the best but plan for other possibilities. As we turn our attention to next year, it is probable that our revenues will decline, for all the reasons we have outlined, but again it is difficult at this point in time to know by exactly how much. For this reason we will model several different scenarios, considering such variables as duration of pandemic, market activity, other signals of economic health and student/family choices.

Efforts like this are only successful when there is transparency about the process and when groups representing all members of the community are engaged. For this reason, we will work within our existing governance structures; for example, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA), the Committee on Mission and Priorities (CMP), Faculty Council and Staff Council. It is likely that we will form working groups as well.

Importantly, we promise to keep the Smith community informed of our work. The extreme uncertainty of these times is unprecedented. Who among us could ever have predicted the events of the past several months—a global pandemic, most of us sheltering in place, and remote learning at a residential college like Smith? But here we are, together in this shared new reality. We cannot predict the future, and we do not have all the answers for how best to move forward. For our part, we promise to lead the college during these unsettling times in good faith.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          Dear alumna,

I write today from the President's House, where I have been mastering the art of the Zoom meeting. One of my favorite spots in the house is the breakfast room, with spectacular views of Paradise Pond, so I have temporarily moved my office there for inspiration.

These are unprecedented times, but I can say with certainty that they have brought out the best in all of us. We speak of Smith as a private college with a public conscience. This means that we take care of one another. In the past month, as we've had to make one difficult decision after another, I have seen our students, faculty, staff and alums come together in ways that have only reinforced my belief that Smith is a college unlike any other. This crisis has ignited our ingenuity and emboldened us to take action to support our neighbors, family, friends and the Smith community.

It has been no surprise to me that alums have been among the most eager to help by offering their ideas, good counsel and philanthropic support, especially to our students. We talk frequently about the power of the Smith network; it has been incredibly moving to see it in action. In the two weeks since we established the Student Emergency Aid Fund, for example, close to 500 alums, parents and friends have contributed in excess of $66,000 to help students defray the costs associated with continuing their studies off campus. To date, more than 200 domestic and international students have been helped with funds for travel, and computer and technology assistance. Thank you for caring so deeply about our students, for keeping Smith strong and for making it possible for us to fulfill our mission.

We have taken numerous steps to try to ease the burden-for students, staff and faculty alike-brought on by this pandemic. We are offering students and their families prorated reimbursements for room and board; we have paid work-study students for the remainder of the semester; we have ensured that the 275 students who cannot return home can remain on campus; we have created an impressive digital support team to make sure that faculty and students have all the tools they need for uninterrupted teaching and learning; we continue to pay all benefits-eligible employees as most of them work from home; we have set up a Smith College Employee Assistance Fund; and we have expanded access to our Employee Assistance Program. These have been significant financial investments, but we believe that they will only serve to strengthen our community in the long term.

Beyond our campus, we are also being a good neighbor to our friends in Northampton. I am proud to share that, in partnership with Cooley Dickinson Hospital, Smith will donate on-campus housing to support the hospital's needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the college is donating supplies-including 250 cots and 80 meals a day-to support expanded sheltering capacity for the local homeless population. This harkens back to the 1918 flu pandemic, when Smith students volunteered as nurses at the hospital, and to World War II, when Smith hosted the WAVES. As history shows, helping in times of crisis and national need is part of our nature.

I also want to recognize the remarkable creativity and resilience of our students. The seniors, especially, have been in my thoughts. As I wrote to them earlier this week, the last semester of college should be a very special time, one for reflecting on what the past four years have meant. I so regret that they will miss cherished traditions like Senior Ball, Baccalaureate and Ivy Day. Before the seniors left, they brought a smile to my face when I witnessed them romping around campus in caps and gowns, heard their primal screams and saw photos of the student-organized commencement.

There are lots of ideas on the table to celebrate and honor their accomplishments, including a virtual celebration on May 17 and an on-campus Commencement with the class of 2020 once we are on the other side of this pandemic. In the meantime, I invite you to send our students a few kind words or a message of support through this form. They always enjoy hearing from you.

As alums, you won't be surprised to learn that our faculty are rising to the challenge of teaching remotely. On Monday, more than 400 courses began in alternate modes of instruction: via Zoom, Moodle, Google chat, Google docs, Slack channels, FaceTime and other media. I'd like to share one example. Laura Lilienkamp '18 of our Design Thinking Initiative is assisting biology professor Nathan Derr in transforming his BIO 317 class into a virtual ""makers class."" Students will receive Lego kits by mail so they can design molecular prototypes remotely and discuss their creations via Zoom. Virtual pedagogies like this will ensure the continued high quality of a Smith education in the weeks ahead.

I am proud to lead a college that has, as one alumna said, such ""a big heart and a social conscience."" The bonds we share cross generations and extend beyond borders. Michelle Stahl AC '95 understands the power of our connections. Two weeks ago, she proposed a virtual Illumination, calling on all Smithies around the world to ""be part of the light"" by hanging a lantern outside their homes at sunset on May 16 and then sharing images across social media. What a fabulous way to keep this Ivy Day tradition alive to brighten-literally-this special day. I'll be hanging one at the President's House, and hopefully a few more on campus.

Let us all continue to care for one another, to connect with our friends and classmates, and to find comfort in knowing that no matter how difficult things may seem there are Smithies everywhere who are ready and willing to stand by our side at every step. I feel your support, and it means so very much to me.

Be well.
Sincerely,
Kathleen McCartney
President, Smith College

          Dear Students:

I have been thinking of you all day, as you finish day one of taking classes remotely. People keep talking about the “new normal”; however not much is normal about this time.

So many of you have emailed notes of encouragement and praise for the faculty and staff who are working so hard to support your studies. I have been sharing your notes with members of my team, many of whom have worked every day for the past three weeks. And I want to give a special shout-out to our digital support team, which has led more than 100 workshops and loaned nearly 150 laptops and other devices to our community in support of our spring courses.

To the seniors, I want you all to know that you have been especially in my thoughts. The last semester of college should be a very special time, as you reflect on what the past four years have meant to you. I so regret that you will miss cherished traditions like Senior Ball, Baccalaureate and Ivy Day. Before you left, you brought a smile to my face when I witnessed you romping around campus in your caps and gowns, heard primal screams and saw photos of the student-organized commencement.

But you will not miss out on a Smith-organized Commencement! It is too early to make an announcement about where and when, because of the extreme uncertainty of the times. That said, we will celebrate the many accomplishments of the great class of 2020 on campus when it is safe and practical to do so.

I know that you are keeping in touch with your professors. Dean Susan Etheredge and I would welcome the opportunity to keep in touch with you as well. To that end, we will be hosting virtual student teas, beginning this Friday with three teas for seniors; subsequent teas will be open to any member of the student body. You will receive information about how to sign up in a later email. By necessity, these events will have to be BYOT (bring your own tea). We very much look forward to conversations with you about your studies, how you are staying connected with one another and what is lifting your spirits. For me, it is FaceTiming with my five grandchildren, ages 7 months to 5 years.

During this crisis, we are doing our best to be good neighbors. As you may know, we are offering campus housing to support Cooley Dickinson Hospital, and we are providing 250 cots and 80 meals per day to help the city of Northampton provide care for the homeless population. I hope this makes you proud of Smith.

Finally, please know how much we miss each of you. Nothing is the same without you, of course. I look forward to the day when I can welcome you all back to campus as students or alums. Until then, stay safe.

With love and friendship,
Kathy

          Dear students, staff and faculty:

I am writing to you today to announce one new resource and one expanded service to support the well-being of students, staff and faculty.

First, we have purchased a license that will allow every student, staff and faculty member to enjoy a free subscription to Calm, a widely lauded relaxation and meditation app.

Here is how you can sign up:

www.calm.com/signup or download the Calm app from the Apple iTunes store on iOS devices or the Google Play Store on Android devices. Create an account using your name and your Smith College email address. Once you sign up, you will automatically have access to your Calm subscription!

This FAQ is helpful for those who have used Calm in the past and need help connecting their existing account to their school subscription. It includes instructions and links for how to download the app and update their email addresses.

Second, we have greatly expanded access to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), a confidential and voluntary counseling referral service, provided free of charge to employees and members of their family household. Every employee—and every member of their family— is now eligible for twelve sessions per topic at no cost; note that there are no limits on topics. The EAP also offers legal and financial consultation and referrals. To use the benefit, call 800-828-6025 and identify yourself as a Smith employee or household/family member of a Smith employee.

If ever there were a time for self care, it is now. We can do some of this work on our own—yoga, dance, walks with physical distancing, and virtual gatherings with friends and family. May these two new resources help all of us take care of ourselves so that we can continue to care for one another.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          Dear Staff and Faculty,

Today, Inside Higher Education did a story on how some colleges are thinking about what we are calling alternate modes of instruction. I am sharing the link, because I think we could all use this uplifting news.

Here is a quote from the article that is essentially a shout-out to Dean of the Faculty and Provost Michael Thurston:

“Smith College in Northampton, Mass., is another college that offers an excellent model for changing how to calculate student success. Seemingly overnight, Smith not only moved to remote learning but also went to a mandatory satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system in order to “recognize the extraordinary character of current circumstances.” Thoughtfully, the Smith FAQ about academic continuity explains, “As we move instruction into alternative modes, we are necessarily changing our agreements about expectations and assessments. In a new and unfamiliar environment, we cannot hold faculty and students to expectations constructed in and for a different instructional experience.” Everything about this statement reaffirms the foundational principles of a liberal arts education, even when conducted at a distance: it should prepare you for whatever challenges might lie ahead outside of college, or, as noted on the Smith College homepage, it is an education designed to “empower the whole you.”

I am so proud of everyone in the Office of the Provost and the Sherrerd Center for Teaching and Learning, who are doing heroic work to support the faculty; of this faculty, who are embracing the myriad challenges of alternate modes of instruction with the right sensibility; and of the many staff supporting our academic mission under these extraordinary circumstances.

Warm regards,
Kathy

          Dear Staff and Faculty,

Last night, a member of the CIRT sent an email to others on the team with the subject line “Good news—gratitude practice.” In her note, she shared a personal update, namely that her son would be coming home from his Peace Corps assignment today. Others followed her lead with their own moments of gratitude from the day: an evening walk without a device in hand, a FaceTime call with a grandson, a first home that is almost ready for move-in day, a grandmother’s 79th birthday, and a sighting of a star magnolia on campus about to bloom.

One year, my Ivy Day speech was about my own gratitude practice. The main lesson of this talk is that we can find something to be grateful for each and every day—even on the difficult days. Every evening before bed, I reflect on this quote from Maya Angelou: Let gratitude be the pillow upon which you kneel to say your nightly prayer. And then I make my list.

If you are like me, perhaps this seemed like a long week. But we all got through this first week of a “new normal” way of working, and I would have to give us all an A+ grade. Let us be grateful for this dedicated, flexible, hard-working, caring community, where our love for Smith students is always at the center.

Warm regards,
Kathy

9,"A Message from President Kathleen McCartney Regarding Commencement and Reunions, March 18, 2020                  ","          
    
          Dear Members of the Smith Community,

It has only been eight days since we asked students to leave campus, if at all possible, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith was among the first colleges to do so, and it is clear that we made the right decision. Since then, my team and I have made countless decisions to mitigate the spread of this virus, for example, by working remotely, as I am doing now.

Yet, there is one decision we have delayed: whether to hold Commencement and Reunions. Like many governors, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has ordered the cancellation of all gatherings of 25 or more people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave similar guidance, recommending that events with more than 50 people be canceled for the next eight weeks. Given that Commencement and Reunion were scheduled soon after, it is with a heavy heart that we have made the decision to cancel these events.

I know that this is a great disappointment to many, especially our seniors and their families. And I recognize that many members of our community will need to cancel travel arrangements. Yet I am confident that most, if not all, of you will agree that this is a prudent decision that protects the best interests of our community and the communities beyond the Grécourt Gates. It is imperative that we do everything we can to mitigate the spread of this virus and to save lives.

For our seniors: Please know how deeply sorry the faculty and staff are that we will not be able to award your diplomas in person this May. When we are on the other side of this pandemic, we will determine a way to recognize the great class of 2020 and to celebrate your many achievements. Last weekend I saw so many of you taking photos by the pond in your caps and gowns; it warmed my heart. I know how hard it was for you to leave this place. We are exploring ways to celebrate with you virtually.

For our alums: I know this news is equally heartbreaking for you. So many of you return every five years to honor your Smith experience, especially the friendships you made here. The communities you have built span nations, time zones and generations. Every year, you demonstrate the power of the Smith network as you share the joy of returning to this campus. We will find a time to come back together and celebrate. We are exploring ways to reschedule your reunion; however, for now we think it is best for us to give a full refund to those of you who have registered.

For the past seven years, Smith alums have inspired me with their love of this college. In challenging times, we know that Smithies rise. Within a day of my announcement regarding COVID-19, alums wrote asking how they could support our students financially. To date, 400 alums have donated more than $53,000 in emergency funding for current students. At the same time, our students rallied in support of one another. Student Government President Rosalie Toupin ’20 has requested that the majority of the remaining funds from the Student Activities Fee be allocated to support students who need computers, travel assistance and more.

For our students: We are committed to prorated reimbursements for room and board; we are adjusting work-study expectations in every need-based financial aid package this spring; we have distributed more than $60,000 in emergency travel funding to approximately 160 students; and we have ensured that the 300 students who cannot return home can remain on campus.

For our staff and faculty: All benefits-eligible employees will continue to be paid (and they will not have to use sick time or vacation time to receive a paycheck). Further, we have established a fund to help families apply for help with medical care and other unexpected COVID-19–related expenses.

The faculty is hard at work adapting their courses so that students can learn through alternate modes of instruction. They are rising to the challenge with a growth mind-set, becoming learners themselves. Staff members are approaching their work with flexibility, dedication and care. I am so proud and grateful to my faculty and staff colleagues.

It seems that every day presents more difficult adjustments that we must all make in responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet I remain grateful for this strong community. And I remain hopeful as individuals practice social distancing and as scientists work to develop needed tests and vaccines.

I am also heartened by everyday acts of kindness I see on the news—children giving concerts for elderly neighbors, virtual birthday parties for people of all ages, and neighbors sharing supplies and groceries with people who cannot leave their homes. Let us take heart and take care as we meet this challenge together with fortitude and grace.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          Dear students,

We would like to explain some key factors that led us to yesterday’s announcement — an announcement we are not alone in making.

We regret we cannot give all students a choice of whether to stay on campus. Let us explain why.

If there were an outbreak of COVID-19, having more students on campus would increase the likelihood that our staff would be overwhelmed and unable to keep themselves and students safe. We are as concerned about the health and safety of our employees as we are for you, our students.

To focus our resources on those most in need, we have resolved to minimize the number of students on campus so that we can:

Ensure that, should a case of COVID-19 affect our campus directly, we have sufficient space available for quarantine and isolation given the number of students remaining. Each quarantine/isolation space requires its own room, restroom and the relocation of close neighbors
	Prepare for a high rate of employee absence and reduction in services should COVID-19 spread within our community
	Enable high-risk employees to begin working remotely or take advantage of the college’s leave policies.
We will first attend to the most vulnerable among us - those students, staff and faculty who fall under the CDC’s guidelines for high-risk complications from COVID-19.

We recognize that vulnerabilities extend beyond the CDC’s clinical definitions. Some members of our community may not have a home beyond Smith. Others have homes to which they cannot return for a range of personal reasons. This is why students have been given the opportunity to request to remain on campus.

We must emphasize the critical importance of minimizing that number to meet our duty of care for students, staff and faculty alike. Our preventative actions today will impact not only the Smith community but also communities far beyond the Grécourt Gates.

Other questions have rightfully turned to the effect these changes will have on work-study students. As we write this, members of our Student Financial Services team are meeting to formalize a plan that will address the needs of work-study students.

We know that not every question about the college’s COVID-19 response has an answer yet. We are continually updating our FAQ. Please know that this is an unprecedented challenge in Smith’s history - but one that we can meet together with proactive planning and a shared responsibility for each other’s safety.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

For the past several weeks, and especially during the past 48 hours, the COVID-19 Incident Response Team and I have been focused on how best to protect the safety of the Smith community, given the expanding spread of COVID-19. I am writing now to let you know that we have made five significant decisions:

In-person classes will be offered on campus through Friday, March 13.
	Spring recess will be extended by one week through Sunday, March 29.
	Alternate modes of instruction will be offered for the curriculum, beginning on March 30. Students will receive more information in the coming days.
	All students must move out of their on-campus housing beginning on Saturday, March 14, and must be moved out by Friday, March 20, at the latest. Students should not expect to return this semester. Students in study-abroad and study-away programs will remain in place.
	Room and board will be provided only to students who have no option but to remain on campus, including those from countries with travel restrictions, those whose legal residence is Smith College and those with other extenuating circumstances. Please fill out this form if this applies to you.
There are many unknowns about the COVID-19 disease, but two things are clear. The first is that social distancing is one of the best protections against the spread of the virus. The second is that the virus has the potential to spread rapidly in communities. Both of these pose challenges for each and every college campus, including Smith.

You may be wondering why we are making this decision now, given that there are no known cases on our campus and few cases in Massachusetts. We believe that spring recess travel presents a potential threat to Smith. Because so many members of our community are planning to leave, their return, from many places, could present a significantly increased risk of exposure to the virus.

These were not easy decisions to make, given our commitment to the residential liberal arts college model. I know that these actions are extremely disruptive for all of us. However, we have a duty to protect and care for the most vulnerable among us—those students, staff and faculty on the CDC’s list of those who are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19.

Students, I know that many of you will be disappointed to leave a place that many of you call home; my heart breaks especially for the seniors. We will do our best to support your studies while we will seek ways to support virtual connections with one another and this campus.

Staff, your work may change in the days ahead, but I know I can count on your partnership, as I have these past seven years. Going forward, we will need everyone’s best ideas to keep our community strong as we support our teaching and research mission.

Faculty, the extension of spring recess is intended to give you time to work with ITS on transitioning your courses to alternate modes of instruction. One example might be to offer lectures and discussions via Zoom. I recognize the special challenges this presents, especially to those of you who offer courses with labs, experiential opportunities and performance instruction. You will receive more information from the Office of the Provost later today about how we will support you through this shift.

Each and every Smith department and team is working to address the ramifications of COVID-19. For example, the Schacht Center for Health and Wellness is preparing to support sick and well students; dining services is transitioning from self to plated service; facilities has implemented enhanced cleaning protocols across campus; Information Technology Services has mobilized all hands on deck to support the shift in academic and administrative operations; and so much more. We are fortunate to be a part of such a committed community.

Importantly, the college is not closing. We will continue to offer the services necessary to meet our core academic mission and serve the needs of our community.

If you have questions, please direct them to covid19info@smith.edu. We will continue to update our FAQ in the coming days to answer your questions.

Smith is a strong community with a vital mission: educating engaged global citizens and leaders to address society’s challenges. In that spirit, we will continue to meet this challenge with resilience, creativity, and abiding care for one another.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          Dear students, staff and faculty:

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have been closely monitoring guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of State and the actions of governments worldwide as we shape Smith’s response to the disease’s spread.

While there is no threat to the Smith campus at this time, we write to inform you of plans in two key areas: international travel and study as well as spring recess.

International travel and study
The college will suspend operations, including study abroad programming, in any country whose CDC warning level reaches alert-level 3, indicating the need to avoid nonessential travel. As of today, China and South Korea fall under this designation. Should the warning for any other country hosting a Smith program or Smith student be raised to CDC level 3, Smith will contact affected students, staff and program providers to plan for possible relocation. Students who have questions regarding changes to study abroad programming are encouraged to contact Lisa Johnson, assistant dean for international studies, at ldjohnson@smith.edu.

Additionally, the college strongly advises that all nonessential business travel to affected areas be canceled.

Spring recess
The college urges every member of the community traveling over spring recess to take appropriate cautions and monitor CDC updates and guidance. Additionally, we recognize that some students will not wish to—or may not be able to—travel over spring break to destinations currently affected by COVID-19. In response to these circumstances, the college is waiving all housing fees for this year’s spring recess for any student who wishes to remain on campus.

Building on our existing emergency plans, the college is finalizing quarantine protocols, ways to sustain our core academic mission should the campus need to be closed for any period of time and ways to support students, faculty and staff over the course of a potential disruption. The college is also anticipating potential impacts on Commencement, Reunion and summer programming. Additionally, the Office of Admission is tracking the effect of travel restrictions on admitted students. Should travel restrictions not permit an admitted student to enroll in the fall of 2020, the college will allow that student to defer the offer of admission for one year.

We will keep you updated as conditions and plans develop. We strongly encourage you to monitor smith.edu/coronavirus, where we are posting updates, letters to the community and resources for students, staff and faculty.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

Dear students, staff and faculty,

We write to condemn recent anonymous Internet posts that targeted a Smith student who is Black. The posts, which were linked to a party on campus, included racial slurs and intimidating threats. The student has been assisted by her dean, residence life staff, her professors, her friends and Campus Police. In follow-up conversations, she has informed Campus Police and her dean she feels safe and supported.

Racial bias and intimidation have no place at Smith College. An investigation is underway. If the individual or individuals who made the posts are identified as members of the Smith community, they will face the Conduct Board and/or other disciplinary bodies as appropriate.

The Office of Multicultural Affairs, Counseling Services and the Center for Religious and Spiritual Life are on alert to assist students who seek support around this incident. The Employee Assistance Program is available for employees.

Programs to educate the community regarding race and racism are ongoing and upcoming. An example of the former is IDP102: Thinking Through Race, a course for which students may earn credit and staff and faculty may audit. Examples of the latter include the Feb. 22 Black Students’ Alliance symposium on race and representation and Professor Loretta Ross’s Calling In the Call Out Culture symposium.

We stand with any in our community who have been harmed by racist speech and acts. Hate in any form is antithetical to the values of this college. We commit to keeping you updated if further information comes to light.

          February 4, 2020

Dear students, staff and faculty,

Last Friday, the Trump administration expanded its travel ban (Proclamation 9723) to add new restrictions on immigration and travel from six countries—Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania—effective February 21, 2020. The new restrictions limit immigrant visas for foreign nationals seeking entry to the United States long-term.

As a member of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, I joined more than 450 college and university presidents in strongly opposing this action and calling for it to be reversed.

While this expansion of the 2017 travel ban is not expected to affect temporary travel or student visas, the ban will, nonetheless, have a chilling effect on international scholarship and the free and open exchange of knowledge.

To those members of our community whose families or countries of origin are affected by this and other travel bans enacted by the current administration: Know that you are welcome at Smith. Know that you are valued at Smith. And know that our community is made stronger by your presence.

Sincerely,

Dear members of the Smith community, 

I am writing to affirm Smith College’s commitment to maintaining an environment that is free of sexual misconduct. That commitment is reflected in our policy prohibiting romantic and sexual relationships between employees and students. 

Recently, we responded to a violation of that policy. The college followed its procedures, conducted an investigation and took positive steps to protect students and employees. 

If you have experienced any conduct in violation of the Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct Policy, I encourage you to report it. There are several channels you can use for reporting and for support. You can contact our Title IX coordinator; speak to a counselor or religious or spiritual adviser; or speak to a class dean or academic adviser. Reports can be made electronically through EthicsPoint, Smith College’s conduct and ethics reporting system.

We take these matters seriously and we are here to help you.

Sexual misconduct has no place at Smith. We are committed to continuing to work with students, staff and faculty to build a culture where all can learn and work in a community of safety and equal opportunity.

          November 18, 2019

Last week, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the legality of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act, whereby undocumented immigrants, brought to the U.S. as children, are able to legally pursue education and employment. Because supporting DACA recipients in our community is of utmost importance to me, I signed several amicus briefs in the cases before the Court. I wanted to ensure that Smith’s voice on behalf of Dreamers could inform the justices’ deliberations.

Court observers say the ruling could be issued anytime between February and June 2020. I write to acknowledge the stress of this period of uncertainty, as the rights and protections of undocumented students are scrutinized once again in the context of profound political division.

Now more than ever, we must and will stand together. Regardless of the Court’s decision, Smith will remain deeply committed to protecting and supporting all members of our community. We maintain our commitments to take no voluntary action that would put members of our community at risk because of their citizenship or immigration status, and we will resist releasing information about students’ citizenship or immigration status. If presented with a subpoena or other imperative, we will seek legal counsel before taking any further steps. Further, we are facilitating access to legal counsel for undocumented students.

Over the last several years, we have taken steps to ensure undocumented and DACA-mented students can continue their education in safety and without interruption. DACA-mented and undocumented students now have equal access to institutional need-based financial aid and campus employment, as well as financial support to cover the costs of meeting immigration-related fees. A number of these changes came about through student awareness-building and advocacy. For example, the Office for Equity and Inclusion, under Floyd Cheung’s leadership, has designated Program and Outreach Coordinator Raven Fowlkes-Witten ’17 to serve as the point person for undocumented students seeking information and/or support.

Smith College has a long and proud history of welcoming students and scholars from around the world, regardless of immigration status. As advocates and allies, we will continue our work to support DACA recipients and undocumented students here and throughout the United States. This nation’s founding values of opportunity and equity are at stake.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          November 14, 2019

I write to update you on the investigation of the 10 swastikas found on our campus on October 24, 2019. 

Since the report of the incident, Campus Police has consulted with multiple law enforcement agencies and conducted multiple interviews as part of their investigation. Here are the findings to date.

There is a broad consensus from the law enforcement community that this incident, while undeniably heinous, does not represent an “active threat of violence to our community nor ties to any organized white nationalist movement.” 
	There are no indications that this act of vandalism is connected to any of the similar incidents within the broader Five College community. 
	There are no active leads or information about potential suspects. I recognize that this is disappointing to all of us.
Just because there is no active threat does not mean that individual members of our community were not harmed. Symbols of hate carry a history of violence to which we must remain cognizant and vigilant. 

So many of you—students, faculty, staff, alumnae, parents and community members—have written to me with messages of support. Let us continue to cultivate Smith as a place where hatred cannot take root.

Last night, Campus Police responded to multiple reports of swastikas drawn in marker on the walls of three of our academic buildings: Seelye, Bass and Burton halls. In a letter to campus last night, we condemned this act of hatred and cowardice. As of this morning, eight swastikas have been discovered and removed.

In the hours following the discovery of these hateful symbols, there has been an outpouring of support from alumnae around the world. One alumna said, “Smith College is my home.... Alums need support for this too.” Another wrote to tell us, “I am thinking of you and all who are dealing with this heinous act at our alma mater, a place we love and cherish and a place where we hope this kind of hate would not exist.”

As is always the case in times like these, alumnae and parents want to know what they can do to help. On campus, we are responding through a community gathering this afternoon, through outreach to and support for the Jewish community and through an active investigation in coordination with local law enforcement.
For those of you who want to take action, we ask you to be what you have always been--a community that stands for and with each other. Send a message to fellow Smithies that hate has no place at Smith by either replying to this email or using the hashtag #SmithRejectsHate on social media so that we can amplify your messages. If you’d like to send a message directly to the Jewish community, please contact Matilda Cantwell, director of religious & spiritual life and college chaplain, at mcantwel@smith.edu.

We will not let this incident define us. Let us stand together now more than ever.

I condemn in the strongest terms this act of hatred and cowardice. I also recognize that these are not just marks on a wall but attacks on our community and the values we hold central to our shared humanity. Hate has no place at Smith.

Our first priority is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of everyone in our community, especially members of the Jewish community and so many others for whom this symbol is an act of violence and an erasure of identity. 

Matilda Cantwell, director of religious and spiritual life, will be in Helen Hills Hills Chapel until midnight tonight to provide a space to reflect and heal in community. We will hear more from Matilda Cantwell and Rabbi Rhonda Shapiro-Reiser tomorrow.

Students who would like to seek support from counseling services are encouraged to call 413-585-2840 to speak with a member of the counseling team.

Campus Police are taking the following actions: 

A full search of campus is underway to look for any further swastikas or related vandalism.
	An immediate investigation has been initiated in coordination with the Northampton Police Department. Members of the community are encouraged to call Campus Police to report any information relevant to this incident.
	All swastikas that we have discovered have been covered, and we are working to remove them permanently.
I am sickened and I am angry. Acts like this are meant to incite fear and division. We will respond, instead, by supporting one another and with our sustained commitment to dismantling the systems from which these abhorrent acts emerge. As we deal with the aftermath, let’s hold each other closely with care and love.

<U+200B><U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

I am pleased to announce that, for the fourth year, I will be offering Innovation Challenge Grants for advancing inclusion and equity. This competitive funding opportunity will support innovative projects that strengthen our community.

I invite all current students, staff and faculty—individually or in groups—to propose innovative projects for funding consideration. Last year’s funded projects ranged in scope, including cross-cultural coalition building, global wellness programming and body-positive workshops.

Proposals will be due November 8th, the day after Otelia Cromwell Day. Proposal guidelines and a submission form can be found at www.smith.edu/innovation-challenge. In addition, an optional information session will be held on Friday, October 25th, at 12:15 p.m. in the Paradise Room of the Conference Center.

As you develop your proposals, please consider the following:

Projects should address one of the thematic areas of need identified by the Inclusion in Action working group: Identity/Representation, Education/Learning, Communication, Engagement, or Justice. Full descriptions can be found here.
	Projects should demonstrate innovative approaches to teaching, research and activism related to inclusion and anti-racism efforts.
	Proposals that take a team approach and engage students, staff and faculty in collaborative projects are particularly encouraged. Students should consult with a faculty member or staff member before submitting a proposal; ideally, this person will serve as a partner for the challenge grant.
	Projects should focus on structural change, and especially on ideas that can be replicated at a larger scale.
	Projects selected for funding must be completed during the timeframe that the primary applicant is at Smith (e.g., a graduating senior may not undertake a project that extends beyond their graduation). Semester-long or calendar year projects will be prioritized.
	Projects that are eligible for funding from other college sources will not be considered.
	Funds may not be used to pay Smith students, staff or faculty.
	Projects that are currently being funded (e.g., current faculty research, programs receiving student activities funding) will not be considered.
	Grants may range in size from $1,000 to $10,000.
A grants review committee, which includes students, staff and faculty, will make funding recommendations to me.

I look forward to supporting our community’s best ideas to advance inclusion and equity on our campus and in our community.

          October 18, 2019

<U+200B><U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

We are pleased to report that the Smith College Board of Trustees at its October meeting made a significant advance in reducing the role of fossil fuel investments in the college’s endowment. The board’s decision follows a recommendation of the Study Group on Climate Change (SGCC) to align more closely our investments with our values. The SGCC report was endorsed by the trustees in 2017.

Specifically, the board voted to approve the following two recommendations brought forward by the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility (ACIR), a subcommittee of the Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees:

Effective immediately, the board will direct Investure, the college’s outsourced endowment management firm, to exclude from the Smith College endowment all future investments with fossil fuel–specific managers. 
	The college will begin an immediate phaseout of all current investments with fossil fuel–specific managers in the Smith College endowment. This phaseout will be achieved through the sale, maturity or liquidation of investments held by fossil fuel–specific managers over a projected period of 15 years.Note: A fossil fuel–specific manager is one whose main strategy is acquiring, developing, producing or exploring for oil/gas; coal mining; or providing oil and/or gas equipment, services and/or pipelines; or that is an investment fund whose primary purpose is to invest in such issues or engage in any such business itself. 
These recommendations are the result of significant work on three fronts. 

First, the college has been working closely with Investure, and other Investure clients, to create new sustainable investment opportunities within the shared investment pools. The ability we now have to select or omit investments with fossil fuel–specific managers is a direct result of that work.

Second, in October 2017, the board of trustees endorsed four strategic recommendations from the ACIR regarding climate change and the Smith endowment and committed to a two-year review of their implementation. As part of that review, which took place in the summer and fall of 2019, the student organization Divest Smith College presented the ACIR with a formal request that Smith further build on the original recommendations by implementing the new sustainable investment opportunities available through Investure. The ACIR studied and endorsed Divest Smith’s request, and the Investment Committee voted to advance the proposal to the Smith College Board of Trustees. 

Third, we remain committed to the SGCC’s recommendation that Smith continually consider how it can contribute to climate-change solutions within the framework of its education mission. These two new actions align with and build on the momentum of our ongoing work, which includes partnering with four other colleges on a 46,000 megawatt-hour solar array in Farmington, Maine; exploring the potential of geothermal energy through a pilot well underway near the Field House; reducing carbon emissions (already down by 29 percent since 2004); and embedding environmental sustainability in more than 100 courses in our curriculum.

As we acknowledge this progress, we recognize that our work is not done. The “Climate Equity and Justice: Solutions in Action” conference earlier this month reminded us that the health of our planet is a complex, urgent problem that affects every aspect of our lives. Consequently, our responses must be equally far-reaching: extending through not only our investments but through every aspect of our operations and our community.

We thank all of you who have contributed to Smith’s ongoing work on climate equity.

Kathleen McCartney

I am writing to inform you that Susan Etheredge ’77, Smith’s dean of the college and vice president for campus life, has decided to return to the faculty and to her full-time role as professor of education and child study on July 1, 2020. Susan plans to retire from the faculty on June 30, 2021.

I am grateful to Susan for her outstanding work over the past two years. Under her leadership, the dean of the college’s office has made several critical investments across all areas of student life. Among those investments: The college developed a strategic plan for student mental health and hired two additional mental health counselors; completed a comprehensive study of residential life, and launched a two-year pilot of identity-based, interest-based affinity housing to cultivate and foster a sense of belonging for students of color; launched the inaugural associate dean for integrative learning; began a process to reenvision the Lazarus Center for Career Development and hired two new positions in that area; and eliminated dining charges for students staying on campus over Thanksgiving and spring break. This year, Susan will lead a review of the first-year student experience, to improve the ways Smith supports incoming students in designing and navigating their curricular and co-curricular paths.

We will conduct a national search for our next dean of the college and vice president for campus life. Please email me at presidentmccartney@smith.edu if you have an interest in exploring the position. 

We will come together to celebrate Susan and her many accomplishments at the end of the academic year. In the meantime, please join me in thanking Susan for all she has done to strengthen the student experience at Smith College.

Dear students, staff and faculty,

The three of us write today to outline our reflections on, and plans for, deepening Smith’s commitment to equity and inclusion, based on our collective work over the summer with many thought partners. 

We began with the goal of defining what inclusion is—and isn’t—in the context of a campus community. We understand inclusion to be intentional, intersectional and ever improvable. It is a dynamic process -- as we each work through stages of learning, knowledge, and engagement. We recognize that inclusion is not assimilation. To borrow a metaphor from music, inclusion means that new voices will not merely add to a predetermined harmony, but also will transform our song.

Next, we created a timeline to make our collective commitments and progress on inclusion—past, present and future—visible and transparent. We want to highlight staffing changes. Specifically, we are adding six staff positions in three areas: Equity and Inclusion, the Counseling Center and the Lazarus Center for Career Development. And we have begun to seek input regarding the enhancement of existing spaces, like the Resource Center for Sexuality and Gender, and the development of new spaces for historically underserved affinity groups.

One of the concerns raised by students last spring was a need for clarity on how members of our community can effect change at Smith. We offer this letter as an invitation to work with us and others through new and established pathways. 

Students, for example, can pursue equity and inclusion initiatives via the Student Government Association. Faculty are represented by Faculty Council and participate in groups rooted in academic departments and divisions, such as the Science Center Committee on Diversity. Staff Council is deeply committed to equity and inclusion programming. Further, many departments, such as the libraries and alumnae relations and development, have established committees and initiatives focused specifically on equity and inclusion. 

In addition, any member of the campus community is invited to join one of five Action Teams—on Identity/Representation, Education/Learning, Communication, Engagement, and Justice—convened by the Office for Equity and Inclusion to develop recommendations from last spring’s Inclusion in Action conference. On Monday, you will learn more in a letter from the Inclusion in Action working group.

Inclusion is a shared responsibility, and we are heartened by the engagement of so many. At the same time, we recognize that some members of the community may feel that being asked to advance inclusion creates an unequal burden for them. Please know that we want your ideas even if you yourself do not choose to serve directly. Each of us has the agency to decide how to engage in this work—and there is still much work to do. This fall, we will be reaching out to hear from members of the Smith community about effective ways to create and sustain an inclusive campus culture. An important touchstone will be Otelia Cromwell Day (Nov. 7), the theme of which, this year, is “Acknowledging Injustice and Practicing Anti-racism.”

The three of us are deeply invested in creating a more just and inclusive Smith, a community where all can thrive. We approach this work from a growth mindset, believing that new abilities—and culture change—can be achieved with effort, learning, and persistence. We wake up every day wanting to get this work right. We are here for you and committed to hearing every voice.


Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney, President

Dear staff and faculty,

As many of you know, Laurie Fenlason has been fulfilling dual roles since my first year at Smith by serving as vice president for public affairs as well as chief strategy officer. I am pleased that she has accepted my invitation to serve full-time as Smith’s vice president for strategic initiatives. In this role she will continue to be responsible for assisting the president with developing, communicating and executing Smith College’s strategy, as she did for Lives of Distinction and Purpose. This role is increasingly common on college campuses. Some of you may recall that David Greene, who supported President Ruth Simmons as chief of staff, later became vice president for strategic initiatives at the University of Chicago. 


I have appointed Sam Masinter, associate vice president for college relations, to serve as interim vice president for public affairs, effective September 1. Since coming to Smith in 2011, Sam has overseen many aspects of the college’s communications and outreach, including community relations, social media, events management and crisis communications. Before coming to Smith, he served as assistant director and acting director of public affairs at Amherst College. 


I am grateful for Laurie’s leadership of College Relations/Public Affairs over her 21 years at Smith and for her team’s outstanding work. I expect to launch a search for our next vice president for public affairs sometime later this academic year. In the meantime, I appreciate Sam’s willingness to serve as interim vice president and am confident that we will continue the visibility, positive positioning and constituent engagement for which Smith is known. 


Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

Dear staff and faculty,

At Smith College, we take seriously our obligation to maintain an environment that is free of sexual and gender-based discrimination, including harassment and violence. Such conduct interferes with the security, well-being and professional climate of our community. It impedes academic success as well as access to educational and employment opportunities. As part of our commitment, we are launching a mandatory online training program for all current and newly hired staff and faculty called Not Anymore. The training focuses on our obligations under Title IX, which prohibits sexual misconduct in all educational institutions that receive federal funding. Online training on this important topic is the most effective way to reach our 1,000+ employees.

Not Anymore is an online video-based program that provides critical information about consent, bystander intervention, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking, and healthy relationships. In addition, Not Anymore has integrated Smith College’s Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct Policy into its materials. This training is an important step in continuing to build our awareness of sexual misconduct, how we can prevent it, and how we should respond to it.

Next week, you will receive instructions for completing the training. If at any time you have questions or concerns regarding the training, or if you require accommodations, such as technical assistance, please contact Amy at ahunter65@smith.edu or x2141.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          June 28, 2019

Dear Members of the Smith College Community:

At the close of the fall semester, an Ada Comstock Scholar visited me during my open office hours in College Hall to say goodbye for the semester and leave me a holiday card. We spoke for a little while, and she told me how Smith had changed her life in just a short time. After she left, I opened her card and read her simple, heartfelt note that ended with: “You are changing our lives and stories without even knowing it.” I think it was the best end to a semester I’ve ever had.

Her message resonated because it served as an important reminder of how deeply meaningful our work is—as educators, mentors and friends—in lifting up and supporting a new generation of leaders, thinkers, creators and advocates.

As we look forward to the summer, I want to celebrate some of the stories and accomplishments that illuminate the many ways, both individually and collectively, we have strengthened our community. We have so much to be proud of.

More and more high school students are seeing the power of a Smith education and want to come here to experience it. In many ways, women’s colleges like Smith are undergoing a renaissance. A recent New York Times article noted that, especially in our current political climate, applicants are embracing the idea of studying at a place that encourages women to reach their full potential. This is reflected in our own admissions. This year, we received 5,597 applications for the class of 2023, the second-highest number in our history. In the past five years, applications to Smith have increased by 25 percent, and we experienced a 52 percent bump in early-decision applications—indicating that Smith is the first-choice college for a growing number of applicants.

Creating a campus environment where everyone feels welcome is the most important work we are doing together. To encourage everyone’s best thinking, we once again sponsored an Innovation Challenge grant program, funding 14 proposals focused on inclusion and equity. Among them was a very successful Dining With Diversity program, in which more than 70 students and alumnae of color gathered over dinner to share their experiences, and a My Global Story initiative, which will collect distinctive narratives of members of our international community.

On April 10, we came together as a community for “Inclusion in Action,” a remarkable day of learning, listening and leading around issues of diversity and inclusion. The conference featured a keynote address from Harvard professor Anthony Jack, 60 workshops, roundtable discussions and performances. The day was an opportunity for us to think about who we are and who we want to be. Important recommendations emerged from the conference, and from the student activism that followed.

This past year, Smith has revised campus policing policies and instituted anti-bias training for all faculty and staff. Going forward, we will launch an affinity housing program in the fall and hire additional staff to focus on student needs. We will continue to work in solidarity to create a campus culture that inspires a true sense of belonging for everyone. Leading us in this critical work as of July 1 will be Professor Floyd Cheung, who was recently named vice president for equity and inclusion.

After spending a year surveying students and conducting research among peer institutions, the Residential Experience Working Group—led by Susan Etheredge ’77, dean of the college and vice president for campus life—released a set of eight recommendations for building community, supporting inclusion and improving the residential experience for all students. My leadership team looks forward to implementing the group’s good work in the months ahead.

It has been exciting to watch the progress of the Neilson Library renovation project. In the past few months alone, the structural design—including the frames for the new “jewel box” extensions on the north and south sides of the building—has become much more visible. We expect to have the roof installed by the start of the fall semester. In the meantime, we honored a longstanding building tradition by inviting the community to sign the last beam before it was placed in early May. So many people wanted to add their names or compose a message that we had to bring in a second “last” beam.

Our commitment to the environment and sustainability garnered us national recognition when Smith College received a Marks of Distinction award from Second Nature for a solar energy-purchasing project the college developed with four other leading liberal arts institutions. In the fall, we will launch our Year on Climate Change initiative by sponsoring a conference on climate equity and justice, on October 4–5. Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and we all can be proud that Smith is putting its resources behind solutions.

Ensuring access to a Smith education has been a priority of mine since I assumed the presidency six years ago. Today, we award close to $80 million a year in financial aid to about 67 percent of our students, making us a true leader in opening the doors to education for students from all backgrounds. In May, we launched Here for Every Voice, an ambitious effort to raise an additional $75 million in scholarship aid for students. The success of this initiative will have an enduring impact on our ability to support the dreams and aspirations of students for generations to come.

From scoring major prizes in the Draper Business Competition to being named among the nation’s top scholar-athletes, students are taking full advantage of the Smith experience and living up to their potential as innovative thinkers, makers and doers. On the national stage, a dozen physics students made it clear that change is afoot in that traditionally male-dominated field—and it’s being led by Smithies. Closer to home, Smith’s A-Super-NOVA team won Best in Show at this year’s Five College DataFest.

Faculty are the heart of our enterprise, and we had the pleasure of recognizing the impact of their work last fall when we awarded the Kathleen Compton Sherrerd ’54 and John J.F. Sherrerd Prizes for Distinguished Teaching to three exemplary teachers who, as the prize states, “show outstanding skill in fostering student learning and engagement.” We welcomed new faculty, and in the spring, we bid a fond farewell to four faculty members who retired this year. 

Throughout the year, we had the privilege of hearing from an array of thought leaders, advocates, activists and scholars. At Rally Day in February, we honored a stellar class of Smith College medalists, all of whom are fulfilling Sophia Smith’s hope that Smith graduates would use their education for the good of the world. As part of our Presidential Colloquium series, we welcomed Me Too movement founder Tarana Burke, So You Want to Talk About Race author Ijeoma Oluo, and philosopher and scholar Martha Nussbaum to share their perspectives on some of the most important issues of the day.

Last month, we were saddened to learn of the death of Adelaide Cromwell ’40, Smith’s first African American faculty member. Adelaide was a steady and inspiring presence on campus, regularly sitting front and center at our annual Otelia Cromwell Day celebration, named in honor of her aunt, the first African American graduate of Smith College. Adelaide was a pioneer in her own right, not only breaking the color barrier at Smith but also founding Boston University’s African American studies program. We proudly honored Adelaide with an honorary degree in 2015 for her contributions to our understanding of race, culture and the Black experience.

We closed the academic year by sending 685 graduates out into the world with this powerful call to action from our Commencement speaker, labor activist Ai-jen Poo: “We need you to take responsibility for the whole—for the whole entire project of taking this vision of democracy into the future—running it all. And doing it differently. Doing it together. With a whole lot of empathy.”

Ai-jen Poo’s message of unity and change echoes our commitment to doing better and bringing our best selves to every endeavor to move Smith—and our world—forward. Thank you for the role you play every day in fulfilling our mission and making Smith stronger. I invite you to watch a video that showcases some of the uplifting and meaningful moments of the past year.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

I am sorry to share that the Smith community has lost a special alumna. Adelaide Cromwell ’40, the first African American professor appointed at Smith, died Saturday, June 8, at the age of 99. Adelaide was the niece of Otelia Cromwell 1900, Smith’s first African American graduate. Many of you will remember Adelaide, who joined us as an honored guest at many of our annual Otelia Cromwell Day convocations. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to know Adelaide and to recognize her achievements with an honorary degree, which the board of trustees awarded her in 2015.

The family is planning a memorial service for Adelaide on November 5 at Boston University, where she was a longtime member of the faculty.

The flag at College Hall will be lowered to half staff in Adelaide’s memory on Tuesday, June 11.

          May 29, 2019

Dear students, staff and faculty:

At the end of the spring semester, we were in the closing stages of our search for a new vice president for equity and inclusion. I thank all of you who participated in meetings and forums with the finalists and provided thoughtful feedback to me and the search committee.

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we did not fill the position.

Rather than continuing the search, I have made the decision to invest in the talent within our own community. Floyd Cheung, professor of English language and literature and of American Studies and director of the Sherrerd Center for Teaching and Learning, has accepted my invitation to serve as Smith’s next vice president for equity and inclusion, effective July 1. Many other institutions have pursued Floyd for positions in inclusion and equity because of his experience in—and passion for—this work. I could not be more pleased to have such a widely respected and committed leader for Smith in this role.

A 20-year member of the Smith community, Floyd teaches and publishes in American literature, American studies and Asian American literature and culture. He is a member of the Five College Asian/Pacific/American Studies Certificate Program, for which he served as the founding chair. In his five years directing the Sherrerd Center, he has focused the Center’s programming on inclusive teaching, by offering panels, workshops and training in such topics as power and privilege in the classroom; by engaging students as partners in teaching and learning; and by promoting the importance of microaffirmation and microresistance. In my conversations with Floyd about the position, he told me “I have been studying race as it intersects with class, gender, and other registers of identity for most of my life. I have been incredibly fortunate to think about this topic through the lens of literature with the fierce and creative students of Smith since 1999. Without consciously planning it, I find myself prepared to answer your call to do the work of promoting equity and inclusion across all sectors of our campus community.”

Before finalizing Floyd’s appointment, I asked him to meet with the search committee and my Cabinet to ensure he heard the community’s needs and aspirations regarding inclusion at this time in Smith’s history. The feedback I received from these groups confirmed that Floyd has the support he will need to create a community in which everyone feels a sense of true belonging.

When classes resume in the fall, I will host a reception for Floyd to welcome him to his new role. An important aspect of Floyd’s initial work will be ensuring momentum on needs and challenges identified through our Inclusion in Action conference and by students advocating for marginalized groups. He will also chair the planning of our Otelia Cromwell Day celebrations.

In closing, please join me in thanking the search committee—Cowiya Arouna ‘21, Matilda Cantwell, Deanna Dixon, Samantha Earp, Amy Hunter, Eseza Kironde ’20, Mona Kulp, Bill Peterson, Danielle Ramdath and Maria Torres—for their commitment, dedication and wise counsel. I am truly grateful for their work.

I am writing to share news about Mike Howard, Smith’s executive vice president for finance and administration, who has accepted a new position as executive vice president of Tufts University, effective July 1. In his new role, he will oversee finance and operations for all of Tufts' undergraduate and graduate programs and schools, including the schools of medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine. I am comforted somewhat by the fact that Mike will be a leader at my alma mater, where he will offer the same extraordinary service he has given to Smith for the past four and a half years. At the same time, I am sad to lose such a talented and dedicated colleague. My Cabinet and I will miss him greatly.

I am grateful for the myriad ways Mike has strengthened Smith College since arriving in December 2014. Mike has been a strategic leader who has  transformed the way we do business across the college, with transparency, collaboration and good humor as his guiding principles. During his time with us, Mike has led our financial sustainability initiative; co-chaired the Study Group on Climate Change; provided oversight for critical facilities projects, including Neilson Library; led our enterprise risk management strategic plan; and supported VP Samantha Earp with our ongoing, significant IT transformation project. These initiatives and many others position Smith well for the future.

I have appointed David DeSwert, associate vice president for finance, to serve as interim vice president for finance and administration. Since coming to Smith in 2007, David has overseen the college’s annual operating and capital budgets and has played a key role in financial planning. He brings skill and experience in financial analysis, planning and forecasting and has served as an important thought partner to Mike and the other members of my Cabinet.

I will host a reception from 3–4:30 p.m. Thursday, June 20, at the Conference Center, so that we can recognize Mike for his many contributions to our community. In the meantime, please join me in thanking him for all he has done for Smith and wishing him the best in his new role.

          May 2, 2019

Dear students:

Before the semester closes, I want to update you on progress toward addressing student demands and recommendations. To date, I have received three sets of demands: from the Unity Presidents Council, from Students for Social Justice and Institutional Change (i.e., the April 11 protest organizers), and from trans students; in addition, members of my team and I have met with several other student groups, for example international students, who have shared additional recommendations. Although each group has a different perspective, they share a common goal that reflects a priority of many members of the Smith community, specifically to create a more just and inclusive Smith where all can thrive.

As I noted in my April 15 letter, I have convened a working group of senior administrators at the college to work on next steps. They have been working to identify the larger problems that underlie the concerns of students, including:

The need for additional staff support, especially for students who feel marginalized by their identities
	The fact that Smith can be difficult to navigate
	The fact that many students feel isolated and lonely
	The need for additional financial resources
	The desire for students to have a greater role in decision-making
	The desire for spaces for affinity groups
One of the lessons for me this past semester is that we face a process problem. Students want greater clarity on how change is made at Smith, while administrators struggle with how to work with student partners. As a result, many questions remain: What should our priorities be to make Smith more inclusive? What are the solutions most likely to be effective? What are we doing now that students value? What are we investing in that students do not value—and should we sunset these activities and redirect the resources?

A second lesson concerns the need to think harder about our shared governance system, because it shapes how we work together in this complex organization. The trustees have fiduciary responsibility for the college; the faculty have curricular responsibility for the college; and the administration has responsibility for long-range planning and day-to-day operations for all units—from student affairs to admission to facilities to IT to communications to fund-raising and more. What, then, should be the role of students as partners in this work? What is the role of the Student Government Association and/or other student leadership organizations? Going forward, my team and I plan to look to students for advice to answer these questions.

For now, I want you to know that I have heard you and that my team is committed to working with you. I plan to identify funds to hire at least two new staff to support students. I will rely on Dean of the College Susan Etheredge ‘77 and our new vice president for equity and inclusion to identify areas of greatest need, and they will consult with student leaders.

Rest assured that my team and I will be working hard over the summer on the issues that concern students most. Further, we will create a living document to make our work more accessible and transparent to students as well as other members of our community.

On Wednesday, a student came to my office hours to ask me how I felt about the April 11 student protest. I told her that I strive to see criticism as caring about the institution. And as I told the students at the protest, it was clarifying for my team and me to learn what kinds of supports students feel they need to be successful and to thrive. Going forward, my team and I hope we can find ways to communicate more effectively with students so that we can work together collaboratively. Each of us is always only an email away.

I wish you all the best with the end of the semester. And to the great class of 2019, I look forward to celebrating with you often during senior week.

Sincerely,

Dear students:

I join so many members of our community in thanking you for your advocacy on behalf of those who do not feel a sense of belonging at Smith. As I told those of you who marched to College Hall on April 11, I was moved by the stories I heard, which helped me to see the pain that some of you are experiencing. I also appreciated receiving greater clarity about your specific concerns and demands.

At the April 10 inclusion conference, many students asked how decisions are made at Smith. I lead a team of dedicated people, and we lead change as a team. Accordingly, I have formed a working group to move forward on next steps. The working group includes Dean of Admission Deanna Dixon, Dean of the College and Vice President for Campus Life Susan Etheredge, Institutional Equity Officer and Title lX Coordinator Amy Hunter, Dean of Students and Associate Dean of the College Julie Ohotnicky, Associate Dean of the College Danielle Ramdath, Dean of Multicultural Affairs L’Tanya Richmond, Vice President for Enrollment Audrey Smith, and Associate Dean for International Study Caitlin Szymkowicz.

I have already committed to several of the items students raised. In February, I informed SGA at a lunch meeting with trustees that we will be hiring two additional mental health counselors with the capacity to respond effectively to the needs of a diverse student body. At the College Hall gathering last week, I pledged to establish a fund to address the costs of learning disability testing for low-income students.

There are many competing demands for resources at Smith. Members of our community have big hopes and dreams for Smith, such as more financial aid, new facilities and new staff positions. As always, any new initiatives would require repurposing existing resources or raising funds. Accordingly, I will be seeking input from students to help me prioritize inclusion initiatives.

Like many of you, I came to the inclusion conference as a learner and a listener, seeking to deepen my understanding of what this community needs. If you attended the opening session of the conference, you heard me say that Smith needs to change. We are called to think, act and speak across difference and to change systems and practices that stand in the way of a truly inclusive community. I look forward to making progress together.

Sincerely,

          January 30, 2019

Dear students, staff and faculty:

Following the events of July 31, I promised regular updates on actions the college is taking in regard to bias prevention and campus safety. This morning, the college and the ACLU are issuing related statements highlighting changes Smith has enacted over the last six months in the areas of policing policies, employee training and support, and communitywide education. The initiatives, particularly those relating to campus policing, were informed by recommendations of the ACLU, which now hopes to share Smith’s new policies with other campuses.

As you know, a painful event led us to reassess and recommit to making Smith a place where each of us feels included and valued. I have heard from so many members of the Smith community—students, staff, faculty and alumnae—about ways to move forward. Many efforts are underway, including training workshops to help us all learn how to have critical conversations to advance our inclusion and equity goals. I look forward to our April 10 inclusion conference, when we will come together as a campus for a day of learning and community building.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          January 15, 2019

Dear students, faculty and staff:

This morning, Hampshire College announced its intent to seek a long-term partner that would allow the college to achieve a sustainable financial future. Details of the announcement are available on the Hampshire website.

Smith College was notified of Hampshire’s intent last week. Since then, Smith has been working to understand the implications of Hampshire’s announcement. Our priority is to provide the best guidance and support to our community, especially those whose areas of work or study intersect with Hampshire College.

I understand that this announcement might raise questions for our community. We will provide updates as we learn more about Hampshire’s planning process going forward.

Since its inception, Hampshire College has been an important force for academic innovation. I hope that a new partnership can sustain that legacy.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          December 14, 2018

Dear students, staff and faculty:

On April 10, 2019, all classes, meetings and events will be canceled so that our entire campus community—students, staff and faculty—can join together for immersive learning about inclusion, diversity and equity. Central to Smith’s mission and values is “creating an inclusive, equitable and accessible educational community founded on the free and open exchange of ideas.” This work is an important step in this direction.

This daylong conference will be an important opportunity to focus on what it means to be a genuine community of belonging for all, as well as to celebrate who we are—and who we aspire to be—as a community.

In January, a steering committee, comprising students, staff, faculty and administrators, will begin shaping the conference program. The steering committee will be supported by The Collaborations Group, a diverse group of facilitators and trainers who have helped create inclusion-related programs for Mount Holyoke and Amherst colleges. The Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity will coordinate the conference, with counsel from the Inclusion Council. One of the first items of business for the steering committee will be to determine the name for the conference.

The more participation we have from all groups within our community, the more meaningful this experience will be. Every student, faculty member and staff member on this campus has knowledge and experience from which each of us can gain greater understanding. I hope that many of you will volunteer to serve as presenters, workshop leaders and performers, whether individually or as groups, departments, clubs or organizations. The steering committee will issue a call for proposals at the beginning of the spring semester.

Learning from one another about our histories and identities, and deepening our understanding of race, class, gender, disability and privilege, will make Smith a stronger community. I look forward to learning alongside you on April 10th.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          November 19, 2018

Dear students, staff and faculty:

It is my pleasure to announce the appointment of Michael Thurston, Helen Means Professor of English Language and Literature, as Smith's next provost and dean of the faculty. He will begin his new role on July 1, 2019.

An authority on American literature and American studies, Michael Thurston has been a member of the Smith faculty since 2000. His primary research interest is modern and contemporary poetry, a genre in which he has authored, co-authored or edited four books. He is also a dedicated teacher who received the Sherrerd Prize for Distinguished Teaching in 2010.

In addition to his research and teaching, Michael has contributed substantially to faculty governance. He has served as chair of Faculty Council, and he currently serves on the Committee on Tenure and Promotion. He has directed the American Studies Program and is currently chairing the English Department.

Described by colleagues as ""a model scholar"" whose ""intellectual vision informs his administrative work,"" Michael impressed me and the search committee as a deep and creative thinker about the future of the liberal arts. He is widely respected by fellow members of the faculty for combining incisive analytical skills with a commitment to fairness and justice. One colleague identified Michael's great strength as ""the ability to frame issues clearly and powerfully, without diminishing their complexity or losing track of what's at stake in the decisions that economic realities send our way.""

The first in his family to go to college, Michael received his undergraduate degree from the University of North Texas and his graduate degrees from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He has a deep awareness of the experiences of first-generation college students and is committed to working in a sustained way to make Smith more inclusive. He regards the work of inclusion, diversity and equity as an ""ongoing and open-ended practice."" I look forward to partnering with him in this work and in many important initiatives -- such as the renovation of Neilson Library, the improvement of our teaching spaces, curricular innovations and the renewal of the faculty -- that are critical to maintaining the academic distinction of Smith College.

In closing, I would like to thank the search committee—Nalini Bhushan, Susan Etheredge, Mike Howard, Daphne Lamothe, Sarah Moore, Kate Queeney, Beth Raffeld, Kevin Rozario, Marianne Yoshioka—for their dedication and discernment in this very significant search. I offer my thanks as well to the dozens of faculty and staff members who met with the finalists. Finally, I am grateful to Joe O'Rourke, Spencer T. and Ann W. Olin Professor of Computer Science and professor of mathematics and statistics, who will continue to serve with great dedication and wisdom as interim provost and dean of the faculty until the close of this academic year.

Please join me in congratulating Michael Thurston and welcoming him to his new role.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President, Smith College

          October 29, 2018

Dear students, staff, faculty and alumnae:

At Smith College, we are committed to an inclusive, diverse and equitable community. That commitment was tested last summer when a Smith employee called Campus Police about a student of color, and questions were raised about whether the call and police response were motivated by racial bias. Today, I write to share the conclusions and recommendations of an independent report into the events of July 31, 2018, so that we can better understand what occurred, learn from the experience, take restorative action and chart our way forward together.

I encourage you to read the report in its entirety. Rather than summarize it, I have chosen to share it with you directly, redacting only those elements that would violate confidentiality commitments we make, as a matter of policy, to those interviewed in an investigation.

The report’s findings are important in two respects. First, they provide a foundation for potential reconciliation and healing for those involved. Second, they include recommendations about Smith’s future, a future in which we recommit to ensuring that every member of our community feels welcome and valued.

I know members of our community will have a range of reactions to the report. Yet, it is my fervent hope that we can come together to share our feelings, concerns, and ideas for creating a more inclusive Smith College together. As a start to the process of change, I am opening Helen Hills Hills Chapel at 12 noon today for students, staff and faculty who want to gather in community. There will be no formal program; rather, this will be an informal opportunity for reflection and conversation. The Student Affairs team, including residence life, religious and spiritual life and multicultural affairs, as well as the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, are additional available resources.

In concert with this email, I have reached out to the co-chairs of the Unity Organizations to schedule a meeting, so that I can hear directly from students of color and seek their advice on next steps for our community. I have also reached out to Staff Council and Faculty Council for their feedback and help as we move forward.

BACKGROUND ON THE INVESTIGATION
Smith College engaged attorneys Anthony Cruthird and Kate Upatham, both of whom are experienced in matters of education, discrimination and civil rights, to conduct an independent investigation. Their charge was to investigate the incident and offer recommendations to our community. During four visits to campus, they conducted in-depth interviews with 11 individuals; visited the site of the incident; and examined policies, protocols and training in relevant departments and programs, including Campus Police, Facilities Management, Dining Services and our Summer at Smith programs for high school girls. I want to thank all of those who participated in the investigation.

FINDINGS
With regard to the employee’s call to Campus Police, the investigators found gaps and conflicting information in individuals’ recollections of events. There were questions and concerns raised, but also plausible non-discriminatory explanations. Weighing these accounts in the context of their overall fact-finding, the investigators ultimately concluded that “the Caller provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for calling the Campus Police on the day of the Incident.” (p. 23) Further, “the Investigative Team did not find sufficient information that this decision was based on the Reported Party’s race or color, or violated the Policy.” (p. 23)

At the same time, the report validates and affirms the student’s lived experience, notably the fear she felt when approached by a Campus Police officer. I recognize that this event has been painful for the student, and that the publication of this report will bring this pain to the forefront again. It is clear to me that we need to foster the capacity for person-to-person conversations—on our campus and in our wider communities—thereby preventing unnecessary escalation involving the police.

After reading the investigation, I suspect many of you will conclude, as I did, that in investigations like this, as in our daily interactions, it is impossible to rule out the potential role of implicit racial bias. Let us begin with this recognition as we embrace the work that lies ahead.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The report identifies two areas for improvement regarding employee policies and trainings as well as policies and trainings specific to campus police, all with the aim of reducing the likelihood of bias-related incidents. These recommendations are closely aligned with suggestions we have received from the student. I want to assure you that the college will pursue these recommendations; in fact, relevant departments on campus have already begun to design and implement new procedures. I will keep you updated on the progress of this work.  

FRAMEWORKS FOR CHANGE
The findings of the investigation represent an inflection point because the report helps to illuminate the areas in which Smith can improve. Education, our primary mission as a college, lies at the heart of prevention and intervention. We have a number of trainings planned for all members of our community, including identity and inclusion workshops, a critical conversations initiative, and online training, each with the goal to build our capacity to engage with differences among us. At the same time, we must continue to work with focus and intention to diversify the student body, the staff and the faculty. The search for our next Vice President for Inclusion, Diversity and Equity will be important in that effort, as will the Target of Opportunity Program I launched last year to increase the representation of faculty of color, especially at the senior ranks. Most importantly, we must commit to changing our culture—reassessing the assumptions and practices, large and small, by which our community functions. Importantly, culture change is an impetus for the work of the newly-formed Residential Experience Working Group.

We recommit to the goal of inclusion in the context of profound racial, religious and political division in the United States and around the world. I remain hopeful that Smith can foster the critically important conversations that will make us a standard-bearer in the work of inclusion, diversity and equity—this must be our steadfast goal. I believe we are called to use this moment, as activist and educator Loretta Ross has said, “to be comfortable with being uncomfortable,” as we build bridges together. This is the most important work of our time.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President, Smith College

<U+200B><U+200B>Dear students, staff and faculty:

Last month I announced that we will be launching new programming, including a number of education and training opportunities. One of these opportunities is the focus of my letter today. The college has partnered with EverFi, a widely respected online learning platform, to provide training on diversity and bias for staff and faculty. The training will cover issues of identity, power and privilege, and will offer tools to promote a culture of respect. I recently completed the training and found it to be valuable. Employees should look for an email soon regarding the training, which will provide access to two courses. Please note that the email sender address will be “donotreply@lawroom.com” and the subject will be “Smith College Diversity and Bias Training.”

Online training is an effective way to reach all of our 1,000 employees, but we plan to do much more. This is but one step toward equipping every member of our community with a common understanding of the ways that difference, privilege and power affect our interactions with one another. As a follow up, the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity will be offering additional in-person training programs that go deeper into these topics. I hope that every employee will take advantage of these supplemental trainings. Please check the Smith eDigest for more information.

If you have questions about the EverFi training or other related programming, please contact Amy Hunter, Title IX Coordinator and Institutional Equity Officer, at ahunter65@smith.edu or ext. 2141.

As a reminder, the process for selecting a commencement speaker is outlined here. Commencement speakers should meet Smith’s criteria for an honorary degree, defined as follows: “The college will consider women who are exemplars of excellence in a wide range of fields, both academic and non-academic. The college will also consider women and men who have had special impact on Smith College, on the education of women, or on women's lives.”

We encourage you to propose outstanding individuals in public service, the arts, education, the sciences, and other fields. As you think about nominees, please remember that highly visible personalities—heads of state and media celebrities, in particular—can be difficult to secure.

We accept nominations on a rolling basis. Please submit your nominations using the nomination form available online. Along with the name of a nominee, please include a short explanation of why you believe this individual is qualified to receive an honorary degree. Your nominations will be shared with the Honorary Degree Committee, whose members will review all nominations and make recommendations to the Board of Trustees.

As mentioned in my September 4 campus letter, I am pleased to announce that, for the third year, I will be offering Innovation Challenge Grants for advancing inclusion, diversity, and equity. This competitive funding opportunity will support innovative projects that strengthen our community.

I invite all current students, staff and faculty—individually or in groups—to propose innovative projects for funding consideration. Last year’s funded projects ranged in scope, including cross-cultural coalition building, global wellness programming and body-positive workshops.

Proposals will be due October 12. Proposal guidelines and a submission form can be found at www.smith.edu/innovation-challenge. In addition, an optional information session will be held on Tuesday, September 18, from 4 to 5 p.m. in Campus Center 204.

As you develop your proposals, please consider the following:

Projects should demonstrate innovative approaches to teaching, research and activism related to inclusion and anti-racism efforts.
	Proposals that take a team approach and engage students, staff and faculty in collaborative projects are particularly encouraged. Students should consult with a faculty member or staff member before submitting a proposal; ideally, this person will serve as a partner for the challenge grant.
	Projects should focus on structural change, and especially on ideas that can be replicated at a larger scale.
	Projects selected for funding must be completed during the timeframe that the primary applicant is at Smith (e.g., a graduating senior may not undertake a project that extends beyond their graduation). Semester-long or calendar year projects will be prioritized.
	Projects that are eligible for funding from other college sources will not be considered.
	Funds may not be used to pay Smith students, staff or faculty.
	Projects that are currently being funded (e.g., current faculty research, programs receiving student activities funding) will not be considered.
	Grants may range in size from $1,000 to $10,000.
I look forward to supporting our community’s best ideas to advance inclusion, diversity and equity on our campus and in our community.

          Tuesday, September 4, 2018

Dear students, staff and faculty,

Welcome to the beginning of the fall 2018 semester. As I noted in my August 30 letter, it has been my tradition to start the academic year by reaffirming our shared commitment to the principles of inclusion, diversity and equity. That commitment carries even greater resonance this fall as we continue to reflect on the events of July 31, as well as on changes in immigration policy, as we work to ensure equity and belonging for all members of our community.  

In that context, we are launching new programming, including a number of education and training opportunities for students, staff and faculty. I write now to share information about our current plans.

Mandatory Anti-Bias Training for Employees
In early October, we will launch mandatory training for all staff on diversity and bias. The training, developed and hosted by the EverFi digital education platform, has been used effectively at many peer institutions. Faculty members will be strongly encouraged to complete the training as well. Please note that Faculty Council and Interim Provost and Dean of the Faculty Joe O’Rourke are committed to working through our faculty governance process to make the training required for faculty.

Critical Conversations Initiative
The Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, in partnership with School for Social Work Professor Peggy O’Neill, is beginning a multiyear initiative to build Smith community members’ capacity to engage differences. During this first year of the Critical Conversations Initiative, a cohort of 15 faculty members will be trained as instructors. The critical conversations model is grounded in noticing, reflecting upon, naming and discussing issues of power and privilege and using those observations to inform social action. The model offers opportunities to reframe how we understand our own identities in relation to one another. It has been found to be a particularly helpful tool for addressing bias and microaggression.  

Identity and Inclusion Workshops
Employees will have the opportunity to participate in workshops in which they will explore their own identities and consider how the impact of power and privilege, as well as the lack of these, can affect the ways in which we understand ourselves and others. In a second series, participants will have the opportunity to explore power and privilege through a lens of systemic marginalization, considering how our own socialization contributes to dynamics of race, class, gender, and other identities. The workshops will start in October and will be led by Dina R. Levi, director of inclusive leadership at Amherst College.

House-Based Programs for Students
Susan Etheredge ’77, dean of the college and vice president for campus life, and her staff look forward to working with the Student Government Association, the House Presidents’ Association and residence life staff to identify training and programming in student houses related to inclusion and belonging. These two issues will also be a central theme of a new Residential Experience Working Group that Dean Etheredge will convene over the course of this academic year. Composed of students, staff and faculty, the working group will conduct a comprehensive examination of how Smith, as an educational institution and a residential college, can optimize the learning potential of living and dining in community.

President’s Innovation Challenge
For the third year in a row, I will be sponsoring the President’s Innovation Challenge, an opportunity for students, faculty and staff to apply for funding to support projects that will advance inclusion, diversity and equity at Smith. Innovation grants can range from $1,000 to $10,000. Projects funded in prior years have addressed support for Dreamers, social justice mediation training, and house events by and for students of color. The program will be administered by Bill Peterson, associate provost, and Amy Hunter, interim director of inclusion, diversity and equity. Look for information soon on how to apply.

Inclusion Council
In all of our inclusion and diversity work, the college will be advised by a newly reconstituted Inclusion Council comprising students, staff and faculty. I will be announcing the members of this Council soon. Among its roles, the council will work with key governance groups to develop a strategic plan to improve inclusion. Further, they will advise on the search for Smith’s next vice president for inclusion, diversity and equity. I will name a committee for that search soon as well.

Speakers and Events
Many departments and centers will sponsor speakers and panels relevant to our inclusion goals. Here is a selection:

On October 13, the Jandon Center will sponsor a public day of mindfulness with Kaira Jewel Lingo, whose work includes a focus on authentic connection.
	On October 29, as part of my Presidential Colloquium Series, I will host University of Maryland Baltimore County President Freeman Hrabowski, a leading advocate for underrepresented students in STEM.
	On November 1, Colorado State University Professor of Education D-L Stewart will keynote our Otelia Cromwell Day convocation. The theme this year is “Healing and Resistance Through Community.”  
	On November 13, I will host a presidential colloquium talk by Ijeoma Oluo, author of So You Want to Talk About Race.
	On March 20, Tarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement, will be the keynote speaker for a gala dedication of our Wurtele Center for Leadership.
	On April 8, I will host a presidential colloquium with Gabrielle Starr, a scholar of English literature whose work extends to neuroscience and the arts; Starr is the first female and first African American president of Pomona College.
I want to close by affirming Smith’s commitment to each of our new and returning students of international backgrounds, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. We are monitoring the increasing and concerning challenges to immigration policy and remain unwavering in protecting and supporting all members of our community.

As you likely know, Trump administration attempts to revoke DACA have faced legal challenges across the country.  While three federal judges have ruled that the government must continue to process DACA applications, the legal status of the program remains unsettled. In light of ongoing uncertainty, we have redoubled our efforts to support our DACA and undocumented students. We joined the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration. And we established an Undocumented Student Working Group, co-chaired by Vice President for Enrollment Audrey Smith and Chief of Staff Joanna Olin. The group’s mission is to address hurdles that undocumented students might face in pursuing full participation in the academic program, the co-curriculum or any aspect of campus life.

At the same time, we are monitoring new federal guidance addressing so-called unlawful presence that could impose harsh penalties for international students, staff and faculty whose visa status is threatened. We are providing our community members with information and support to help ensure that their visa status remains in order and will continue to advocate for policies that create a welcoming environment for immigrant, undocumented and international students on U.S. campuses. In this climate of ever-tightening immigration regulations, we underscore our appreciation for the international students, staff and faculty members of the Smith community.

So much of what a college administration does is invisible to members of the community. I hope this letter provides a window into the work we are launching this year to promote inclusion and create structural change at Smith. If you have additional ideas, I would welcome hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          Thursday, August 30, 2018

Dear students, staff and faculty,

I write to offer updates and reflections on the July 31 call about a student to Campus Police.

A number of you have written to me to express concern for the student, especially as we begin the new semester. I want to assure you that I have reached out to her, offered a meeting and apologized on behalf of the college. Dean of the College Susan Etheredge ’77 and her team have been in contact with the student as well, to offer their support.

While the investigation of the incident is ongoing, both the student and the staff member have been invited to participate in mediation, a voluntary process that can offer a path forward for both parties. A core tenet of restorative justice is to provide people with the opportunity for willing apology, forgiveness and reconciliation.

In the context of a profoundly divided political and social climate, in this country and around the world, it is urgent that we, as members of an educational community, learn to speak with one another, not past one another, when we disagree, and to do so with the goal of true understanding. Learning how to have authentic conversations about our identities, especially race and class, is among the most challenging work many of us do—and we all need to learn how to do this work better.

I offer a case in point by sharing several excerpts from the hundreds of messages I have received from students, faculty, staff and alumnae, about the July 31 incident. As you will see, members of our community have expressed a range of perspectives. While you might disagree—even vehemently—with one or all of these viewpoints, they provide a way to understand the challenge that lies ahead in healing and improving our community.

“It's not really possible to articulate a ‘truth’ about which experiences are and which are not influenced by race. For the student, race was most certainly central because it speaks to every part of her life experience and how she has seen Black people treated. People of color can feel frustrated by the question—Was race involved?—because to ask the question does not recognize their life experience.”
	“While instances of racial profiling can stem from hate, I also believe such profiling often stems from a lack of education on the matter. I'm sure many Smith students, employees and faculty come from predominantly white communities, and they, perhaps, have been directly or indirectly taught to fear people who appear different from themselves.”
	“At this point the lives of three dedicated staff members have been seriously disrupted, their jobs have been jeopardized, they have been labeled as racists and have had nasty comments and threats directed at them.”
	“The student was extremely hurt by the incident. AND the caller might not have done anything wrong, given the context and the instructions from the college about how to handle suspicions. Both can be true.”
	“We all think we know the story. We only know the perspective we bring to it.”
Let us each ask ourselves how we move from different perspectives, like these, to deeper understanding and needed structural changes. I am heartened by the fact that a number of our faculty and staff members have been piloting programs to examine the ways in which race, gender, class, implicit bias and power influence our assumptions, interactions and conversations. Clearly, Smith has a great deal to do to ensure that the college is a place where each of us feels we belong. I have never worked at a college or university as committed to social justice as Smith College. However imperfect our campus community—indeed, our world—might be, this ongoing commitment gives me hope.

Each year, I send a message to the community about our sustained work on inclusion, diversity and equity. You will hear more from me soon about specific opportunities for training and education, with the goal of meaningful, systemic change. I embrace the work that lies ahead.

Sincerely,

          Thursday, August 2, 2018

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty,

As you know, on July 31 a student of color on the Smith campus was approached by Campus Police, because a Smith staff person reported seeing someone who appeared to be “out of place.” I begin by offering the student involved my deepest apology that this incident occurred and to assure her that she belongs in all Smith spaces. This painful incident reminds us of the ongoing legacy of racism and bias in which people of color are targeted while simply going about the business of their daily lives. It is a powerful reminder that building an inclusive, diverse and sustainable community is urgent and ongoing work.

I have been hearing from members of our community, and I want you to know that I am listening. One young alumna speaks for so many when she writes, “The incident that occurred on campus this week was disappointing and saddening. It's a stark reminder that we have work to do still to make Smith a place where students of color are seen as students and not intruders; that student workers are respected and acknowledged as belonging and mattering.”

Although Smith has been and continues to be committed to promoting a just and inclusive environment for all members of our community, we continue to fall short even as we continue to make progress. But when we fall short in our responsibility to support our students, it is a particularly hard moment for all of us. Clearly, we have important work to do going forward as a community. I write now to inform you of some next steps in our work to hold Smith to the highest standards with respect to inclusion, diversity and equity for all members of our community.  

As members of an academic community, we know that education lies at the heart of prevention as well as intervention. Beginning this fall, every Smith staff member will be required to participate in mandatory anti-bias training. In addition, the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (OIDE), in partnership with Human Resources and the School for Social Work, will hold a series of workshops for faculty and staff focused specifically on topics of identity, inclusion, bias-response and bias-prevention. Further, OIDE will work with Campus Police to strengthen the protocols by which they triage, assess and respond to calls for assistance. And I will continue to offer innovation grants to support student, faculty and staff ideas around inclusion.

Importantly, the college is engaging a third-party investigator to conduct a thorough review of this incident. Although privacy laws preclude Smith from making public personnel-related outcomes of any investigation, I commit to sharing with you any recommendations on policies, procedures or further community training that result.

Members of the Smith campus community share a responsibility to ensure that each of us is safe and each of us is treated with respect. As president, I have made this work a priority, and I will continue to do so in collaboration with vice presidents and senior staff, the Inclusion Council, Faculty Council, Staff Council and the Student Government Association. But we need everyone’s input, and we pledge to listen to you. To that end, I encourage members of our community to send me their ideas via this form. I look forward to partnering with you all in this work as we redress past wrongs and redouble our prevention efforts so that incidents like this never happen again. This work will take reflection and sustained commitment. I am confident this community will rise to the challenge; there is no work that is more important.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

Dear students, staff and faculty,

It is my pleasure to announce the appointment of two individuals to positions supporting important initiatives in our strategic plan.

Effective August 1, Borjana Mikic, the R. B. Hewlett 1940 Professor of Engineering, has been appointed to the newly established position of associate dean for integrative learning. In that role, she will advance and coordinate experiential learning opportunities for students. Reporting jointly to Interim Provost and Dean of the Faculty Joseph O’Rourke and Dean of the College and Vice President for Campus Life Susan Etheredge ’77, Borjana will work closely with staff and faculty in our centers and our concentrations program, and will oversee the Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, the Design Thinking Initiative, and the Wurtele Center for Leadership. By creating synergies among these areas, she will help shape programming, in collaboration with dedicated faculty and staff, in ways that resonate with the goals of a liberal arts education. Given Borjana’s strong record of innovation and creativity in her own field and in design thinking, she is well positioned to serve in this important role at the nexus of the curriculum and co-curriculum.

Effective August 30, Dina Venezky will serve as the first executive director for nondegree programs, reporting to Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration Mike Howard. Building on the success of our executive education and precollege summer programs, Dina will be responsible for expanding our offerings in the revenue-generating nondegree programs market, bringing Smith’s long experience in women’s education and leadership to broader audiences across the lifespan. Dina comes to Smith from executive education at Stanford Graduate School of Business. She graduated from Smith in 1992 and received her doctorate in geological sciences from Brown University. Expanding our revenue streams via nondegree offerings has been one of my key priorities since coming to Smith; I am confident that Dina’s experience in start-ups, executive education and academia, as well as her passion for Smith and women’s leadership, will advance this priority area in an innovative and strategic way.

Please join me in congratulating Borjana and Dina and supporting them in their new roles.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          June 29, 2018

Dear Members of the Smith College Community:

Certain moments throughout the year always stand out: announcing Mountain Day (and being witness to a pop-up wedding in my backyard), awarding Smith Medals to incredible alumnae during Rally Day, learning of a professor’s prestigious award, hearing a student share a story about how Smith changed her life, or presenting staff with Spotlight Awards for exceptional service.

During these times I like to pause and remind myself of what a privilege it is to be part of such a remarkable community. I expressed similar thoughts during Commencement and Reunion this year, when I told the graduating seniors and the thousands of alumnae gathered on campus that they are forever members of a community unlike any other, a community that will provide support and sustenance throughout their lives.

As we settle into the summer months, I want to reflect on some of what we have accomplished together and share my gratitude for all you do in supporting our mission to educate women of promise for lives of distinction and purpose.

The past year has been one of great momentum, a year marked by the launch of new programs and initiatives that underscore just how much our work, our creativity and our collective activism benefit the common good.

Once again, we broke records for the number of applications for admission, with 5,780 applications to the class of 2022. Overall, we’ve seen applications increase by 31 percent over the past five years. This speaks directly to Smith’s reputation for providing students with an education of unsurpassed quality.

At a time when access to college is more important than ever, we have taken great care to sustain our generous financial aid program, thereby keeping the doors to a Smith education open to the most qualified, ambitious students, regardless of their backgrounds. More than 65 percent of our students receive institutional aid. All totaled, we awarded close to $70 million in Smith scholarship support to students last year. In a letter to The New York Times, I reaffirmed the value of higher education for all students, regardless of need.

In October, we officially broke ground for what will be the largest capital project in our history—the renovation of Neilson Library. Maya Lin’s design—inside and out—is a work of art, combining elements of nature with cutting-edge technology to create a space that is beautiful, sustainable and responsive to the current and future needs of our students and scholars. The renovation is progressing on time, and alumnae and friends of the college have provided a wellspring of support—contributing more than $31 million toward construction and programming.

In and out of the classroom, we have embraced a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, as more women are seeking opportunities to showcase their skills and talents as leaders in the worlds of business and finance. College magazine named Smith among its top three colleges for female entrepreneurs who want to change the world. The most visible sign of this movement on campus is the Jill Ker Conway Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center, which we dedicated last fall. Already, through the center’s financial education and business development programming, students are acquiring the skills they’ll need to change the landscape for women in business. They are learning how to pitch their entrepreneurial ventures to potential investors and are working with local mentors and organizations to bring their innovative ideas to life. This year’s Draper Competition was bigger and better than ever. Fifty-two teams, including 18 from Smith, participated in a daylong festival that included the traditional business pitch competition, along with new elements like virtual reality stations and a battle of the bands. I am proud that Smith is home to an event that showcases our students’ talents and entrepreneurial spirit.

Throughout the year, I was inspired by how often we came together to take a stand against some of the big issues affecting members of our community, especially anti-immigration policies, gun violence in schools and sexual harassment. When the administration vowed to rescind DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, we reaffirmed our commitment to protecting all members of our community. Diana Umana ’19 bravely shared her story as a Dreamer to help raise awareness about the plight of undocumented people. “Activism helps keep me positive,” she said. “It makes me feel like I’m contributing to something good.” When high school students organized March for Our Lives, dozens of Smith students, faculty and staff gathered for a rally at the Campus Center to demand action against gun violence. A couple of days later, a busload of students joined thousands of others from around the state at the March for Our Lives in Boston to raise their voices in support of legislation to address gun violence in schools. And I am very proud that several of our alumnae were on the front lines of the #MeToo movement, adding power to a seismic shift in attitudes toward sexual harassment.

Across the curriculum, we celebrated innovations in what and how we teach. Associate Professor of Government Brent Durbin introduced students to what he calls “the big data revolution” and how it is affecting politics and social change. Jennifer Malkowski, assistant professor of film and media studies, is teaching students to examine representations of race, gender and sexuality in video games; she is also conducting pioneering research on the important topic of documenting death in the digital age. Courses in Design Thinking opened students’ minds to new, more human-centered, ways of exploring—and solving—problems. And Jack Loveless, associate professor of geosciences, brought Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to the classroom, leading groups of students through the process of producing data-driven digital maps that illustrate ideas like the relationship between trees on campus and how Smith might enhance its composting program.

Creating a more inclusive campus remains at the core of everything we do. Last fall, for the second year in a row, we awarded Innovation Challenge grants to 16 proposals that improve diversity, inclusion and equity on campus and in our community. Our community is richer, more compassionate and welcoming because of new initiatives that trained students to act as Dreamer Supporters, assisted African and Caribbean students in accessing internships and mentors, and encouraged us to think about how good food can build community. In April, I had the pleasure of welcoming some 200 alumnae to campus for the Women of Color conference. The theme “Possibilities, Persistence and the Power of Our Voices,” was particularly resonant; it conveyed hope, strength and action—all of which the world needs right now.

The School for Social Work is in the midst of a grand centennial celebration. Lectures, performances and a new documentary all pay homage to its powerful legacy as the first school for social work in the country. To this day, the school, with its mission to empower change and stand against racism, serves as a model for other programs around the country.

There are many more moments, honors and distinctions to recognize as well. Professor Jill de Villiers was named a 2018 fellow to the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Abby Bergman ’18 became the sixth Smith alumna to successfully swim the English Channel. Gracie Hackenberg ’18 led a team of student engineers in building a race car and ultimately placed seventh in the national Grassroots Motorsports Challenge last fall. In the midst of the country’s immigration debate, we announced the creation of a new scholarship fund in support of refugee and undocumented students. Civil rights icon Ruby Bridges inspired us with a speech about the importance of dignity, grace and understanding at a time when our society seems so divided. The Smith Alumnae Quarterly magazine picked up two gold awards for creative excellence from the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE). And we announced an exciting new partnership with four other colleges in the New England College Renewable Partnership, allowing us to reduce costs and collectively offset about 46,000 megawatt hours of electricity. It is all part of our effort to develop sustainable, collaborative solutions that, over time, will significantly lessen Smith’s environmental impact.

Sadly, on June 1 we learned of the death of Jill Ker Conway, Smith’s seventh—and first woman—president. Jill’s impact and place within our history continues to be felt. She was a true champion of women’s education and fostered a campus culture that celebrated, as she once said, “women’s intellectual bravado.” Even after leaving Smith in 1985, she remained a close friend and mentor to students and alumnae around the world. To honor her memory, we’ve planned a campus memorial service for October 18 at Helen Hills Hills Chapel.   

Poet and Pulitzer Prize winner Rita Dove helped us close out the academic year with a moving meditation to the class of 2018 on the power of knowledge. She left us with what she called a simple path to wisdom: “Start with what you know; then, as you venture into the world...apply what you’ve learned along the way, never forgetting that the key to the kingdom of knowledge is linked to curiosity and appreciation.”  

In that spirit, please accept my thanks for all that you do to move this great college forward. We share membership in a community that cares deeply for one another. In everything we do, we have a greater purpose in mind—to prepare women for leadership, steward our resources in responsible, sustainable ways and imagine a more equitable, just world. I invite you to enjoy a video of images from the past year that capture the distinct energy, joy and passion that make Smith so special.

Enjoy your summer!

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          June 2, 2018

Dear students, staff and faculty:

Late yesterday, President Emerita Jill Ker Conway, a renowned historian and author who served as Smith College’s president from 1975 to 1985, passed away at the age of 83. A visionary leader whose work had centered on women’s history, Jill focused her presidency on conceiving and launching new opportunities for women, through such initiatives as the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, the Smith Management Program (now Smith Executive Education), and significant investments in career development and athletics. Her autobiography, told in three volumes—The Road From Coorain, True North and A Woman’s Education—recounts the intellectual journey of the first woman to serve as Smith's president. Her other books included Women Reformers and American Culture.

On a personal note, Jill was a generous friend to me and one of the first to reach out when I was appointed to the Smith presidency. She was gracious with her wisdom and advice about the unique community I was about to join. She reminded me of the legacy with which I had been entrusted, and about the power of Smith as a place where students have permission to be curious and to proudly express, as she once said, their “intellectual bravado.”

Jill was a true champion of women everywhere. I invite you to read this remembrance and offer your own memories in the comments.

The flag at College Hall will be lowered to half staff in Jill’s memory on Monday, June 4. Funeral services will be held at St. Mark’s Church, Conway, Mass., on Saturday, June 9. A memorial will be held on campus later this year.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          May 16, 2018

Dear colleagues,

One of the most compelling themes of our strategic plan is the emphasis on experiential learning opportunities for our students. As we implement the strategic plan, we need to ensure that co-curricular opportunities are not merely additive to our students’ curricular pursuits; rather, the two should be integrated effectively in service of our students’ academic experience here at Smith. This has become clear in committee discussions this year, notably in the Committee on Mission and Priorities.

To that end, I have decided to pilot a new position titled Associate Dean for Integrative Learning, to be held by a current faculty member. The associate dean’s overall charge will be to support and coordinate the efforts of faculty and staff as they create opportunities for students to integrate knowledge and hands-on experiences. The responsibilities of the role will include:

Studying and disseminating best practices for integrative learning, in collaboration with the directors of the Concentrations, the Center for the Environment, Ecological Design & Sustainability, the Jandon Center for Community Collaboration, the Lewis Global Studies Center, and the Summer Research Fellowship Program.
	Overseeing the Conway Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, the Design Thinking Initiative, and the Wurtele Center for Leadership. By creating synergies among the programming in these three units, the dean will help shape our conception of innovation and leadership in ways that resonate with the goals of a liberal arts education.
	Partnering with the Lazarus Career Development Center, the Faculty Director of Advising, Class Deans, and the Sherrerd Center for Teaching and Learning to think systematically about how students craft a meaningful four-year educational experience that is greater the sum of its parts.
Given the position of this role at the nexus of the curriculum and co-curriculum, the associate dean will report jointly to the dean of the college and the provost and dean of the faculty. The position will be considered experimental and term-limited; after three years, the continued need for the role will be re-assessed.

I have asked Interim Provost Joe O’Rourke and Dean of the College Susan Etheredge to lead the search for the Associate Dean of Integrative Learning. You will hear more soon about the process for nominations and self-nominations.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          May 3, 2018

Dear students, staff and faculty:

Recently, we have seen encouraging rulings from the federal courts in regard to the DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. However, the lack of certainty about DACA’s future means that we need to continue planning for students’ safety, security and ability to continue their education without interruption.

Earlier this year, judges in San Francisco and New York issued injunctions reinstating DACA recipients’ right to renew their enrollment in the program. A few weeks ago, in a case brought by Princeton University and others, for which Smith signed a friend-of-the-court brief, a Washington, D.C., judge ruled that the Trump administration must reinstate DACA. If the D.C. court’s ruling stands after 90 days, the federal government will be compelled to accept DACA renewals as well as new DACA applications.

While observers are cautiously optimistic about these developments, the DACA program is still at risk. To that end, I want to highlight two recent initiatives:

Undocumented Students Working Group Earlier this spring, in coordination with the student group OUSR (Organizing for Undocumented Students’ Rights), we formalized our day-to-day support for undocumented students by convening a working group co-chaired by Audrey Smith, vice president for enrollment, and David Carreon Bradley, vice president for inclusion, diversity and equity. The other members of the working group are Julie Ohotnicky, dean of students; Josh Miller, professor of social work; Michelle Joffroy, associate professor of Spanish; Michael Ireland, associate director of Student Financial Services; and two student members. An OUSR member will attend the working group meetings on a rotating basis. The group met once this semester and will meet regularly next fall to ensure that we are actively anticipating issues that might prevent undocumented students from participating fully in the Smith experience.
	Dreamer Supporters In late March, with funding from an Innovation Challenge grant, 25 Smith students participated in a two-day training to become Dreamer Supporters. The training, organized by the School for Social Work, OUSR and the Center for Religious and Spiritual Life, prepared the students to serve as resources for students and departments, at Smith and at area colleges, in navigating the challenges faced by undocumented college students. In addition, the trained students are now prepared to train others to help undocumented students feel secure and supported. I am grateful to Professor Joshua Miller and the experts he convened to make this opportunity possible.
I want to reiterate and reaffirm the college’s commitment to protecting and supporting all members of our community. As we have said from the beginning, Smith will

Take no voluntary action that would put members of our community at risk because of their citizenship or immigration status.
	Resist releasing information about students’ citizenship or immigration status unless we are legally compelled to do so; if presented with a subpoena or other imperative, we will seek legal counsel before taking any steps to comply.
In closing, I thank all of you who have supported, educated and advocated on behalf of undocumented students. Amid a national climate of fear and division, your work is helping to keep us united as a campus and a community.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

Dear students, staff and faculty:

A number of people have written to me, Dean Etheredge and other college staff members to convey concerns about the interactions of a Campus Police officer with a Smith student when called to the scene of an emergency on April 17. We have responded to individual inquiries; I write now to inform the campus community about our next steps.

Campus Police officers, who serve the Smith, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke campuses as a joint force, are held to the highest standards of conduct and undergo regular training, including mental health first-responder training. The April 17 Campus Police response is under active investigation by Smith’s officer in charge, Lieutenant Susan Dawley, and Campus Police Chief Francisco Ortiz, in consultation with Vice President for Inclusion, Diversity and Equity David Carreon Bradley. During the investigation, the officer in question is on leave and not actively serving on any campus.

Like all colleges, universities and health care providers, Smith is bound by clear and specific regulations that prohibit us from commenting on an individual’s health status. This is both a legal requirement and a commitment to individual privacy. I am grateful for the concern expressed about the student and trust that community members will understand why we cannot comment on the individual’s status.

Smith College places the highest priority on students’ safety, health and well-being. My team and I are committed to responding promptly, appropriately and compassionately to students in need of medical or emotional care. In the last three years, we have expanded the counseling center staff to help meet the needs of our students. Currently, we are assessing our mental health services, with the support of the JED Foundation and a committee of students, staff, faculty and representatives from Campus Police.

The resources of the Office of the Dean of the College, including those of the Schacht Center for Health and Wellness as well as the those of the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, are available for support or to report an issue of concern. Our Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct Policy affirms our commitment to maintaining an environment that is free of sexual and gender-based discrimination and harassment of any kind.

There is nothing more important to me than ensuring that everyone at Smith College is treated with respect. I want everyone, especially our students, to know that I and my team are committed to redressing wrongs, to improving our education and trainings, and to delivering the kind of academic, social and health experience and support that will enable our community to thrive.

Sincerely,

Dear students, staff and faculty:

In recent weeks and months, we have been shocked, saddened and outraged by deadly violence in our schools. In response to the shooting at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a remarkable movement has emerged, thanks to high school students demanding action against gun violence. Several members of our community, including me, have organized a teach-in on school violence this Thursday, March 22, which is two days before the national marches scheduled across the country. The goal of this teach-in is to come together as a community in support of students across the nation who are organizing for the right to learn in safety.

We will raise our voices at a noontime rally at the Campus Center, committing ourselves to ways we can each support this movement and contribute to preventing school violence.
	We will learn from experts at a panel titled “School Shootings, School Violence and the Damage Done: Prevention and Response” at 4:30 p.m. in Weinstein Auditorium. Among the speakers will be Professor Victoria Banyard, University of New Hampshire; Anne Gilligan, Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education; Senior Lecturer Megan Harding, Smith College School for Social Work; and Dean and Professor Marianne Yoshioka, Smith College School for Social Work.
	We will host a community phone bank in the Campus Center from 1 to 4 p.m. for those who wish to contact legislators about gun violence and school safety.
The college will also provide a bus on Saturday, March 24, for those who wish to join the March for Our Lives in Boston.

Details on all events can be found here.

It is clear that higher education has a role to play in the movement to end violence in our schools. The American Council on Education has launched an initiative on Guns, Campus Safety, and Higher Education Civic Engagement, which will aggregate resources for ongoing activism and teaching.

I hope to see many of you on Thursday.

Dear students, staff and faculty:



I am writing with news about an important member of our community. Jennifer Chrisler ’92, who has served as vice president for alumnae relations and executive director of the alumnae association, has been appointed vice chancellor for advancement at UMass Dartmouth, a regional research university in southeastern Massachusetts. This is a terrific opportunity for Jennifer to build and lead engagement and fundraising programs in support of the university’s teaching and research priorities.



In her five years at Smith Jennifer has led innovative alumnae engagement programs that have reinforced Smith’s standing as a thought leader on global women’s issues and connected alumnae to students in meaningful ways. In concert with the Alumnae Association of Smith College board of directors, she has launched alumnae programming aligned with the college’s strategic objectives, including the Smith Business Network, the Women of Color conference, and the student ambassador program.



I am grateful to Beth Raffeld, vice president for development, who will provide interim leadership for alumnae relations while she continues in her current role with development.



Jennifer’s last day at Smith will be March 30. I will miss her leadership and counsel, her creative programming ideas and her commitment to ensuring Smith alumnae stay close and connected to their alma mater. Please join me in thanking Jennifer for all she has done for Smith College and wishing her all the best in her new endeavor.

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

As you know, President Trump issued an executive order last September rescinding DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Unless Congress enacts a permanent, long-term solution by Monday, March 5, protections offered to an estimated 800,000 undocumented youth, brought to the U.S. as children, may disappear.

Despite numerous legal challenges, intense advocacy efforts and bipartisan legislative proposals, the future of DACA beyond next week’s deadline remains uncertain. This is a concern felt deeply in our community. Students like Diana Umana ’19 have bravely told their stories in the hope that the imperative for change will be felt more acutely and personally. The most effective way to shape public opinion and influence legislation is through powerful individual stories.

Many of you have reached out to your elected officials to join in efforts to support DACA recipients. I want to particularly commend the advocacy of students involved in OUSR—the Organization for Undocumented Students’ Rights.

Know that you are not alone in your advocacy. Since September, college and university presidents have worked collectively across higher education and beyond to stand against the administration’s actions. As you may know, I signed the American Council on Education’s letter to Congress as well as an amicus (friend of the court) brief in a suit brought by the University of California against the Department of Homeland Security. Smith's September 5, 2017, statement is specifically cited in the amicus brief. And I joined the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, committing to advancing policies that support and welcome immigrant, undocumented and international students.

As the March 5 deadline approaches, I would like to reiterate Smith’s commitment to protecting and supporting members of our community. We stand by our commitments to

Take no voluntary action that would put members of our community at risk because of their citizenship or immigration status.
	Resist releasing information about students’ citizenship or immigration status unless we are legally compelled to do so; if presented with a subpoena or other imperative, we will seek legal counsel before taking any steps to comply.
In addition, a proposal to train Smith students to act as Dreamer Supporters was recently awarded a grant through the president's Innovation Challenge program. The School for Social Work, OUSR and the college’s Center for Religious and Spiritual Life will train as many as 25 Smith students, who will then serve as resources for offices at Smith and at area colleges.

In the face of anxiety and uncertainty, many of us will continue to pressure members of Congress. Equally important, let’s make clear our commitment to providing strength, kindness and support to every person who calls Smith home. We are strongest as a community when we stand with and for one another in defense of our shared values of inclusion and access.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          February 20, 2018

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

Moments ago, the College of William and Mary announced its 28th president: Smith College Provost and Dean of Faculty Katherine Rowe. Founded in 1693, William and Mary is a public Ivy, and the second-oldest college in the nation. Katherine will be its first woman president.

I am extremely proud of Katherine and profoundly grateful to her, as are my colleagues on the board of trustees, for the innovative and farsighted academic leadership she has brought to Smith. Among her many achievements are the establishment of our Statistical and Data Sciences major, one of the first at a liberal arts college; development of the program for the new Neilson Library; and fulfillment of our 10-year NEASC re-accreditation self-study. She leaves a legacy that will be felt for years to come.

I have appointed Joe O’Rourke, Spencer T. and Ann W. Olin Professor of Computer Science and Professor of Mathematics & Statistics, as our interim provost while I conduct a search. A member of the Smith faculty since 1988, Joe served as associate provost from 2012 through 2015; he will take up the interim provost role on June 1. I am grateful to Joe for interrupting his sabbatical to take on this critical leadership role for the college.

Please join me in congratulating Katherine. I will host a reception in Katherine’s honor toward the end of the semester to celebrate and thank her for her many contributions to our community.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

          February 5, 2018

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

In my January 22 letter, I provided an update on our five-year financial sustainability initiative and invited your questions. I write to address those questions and provide further updates.

As I have said in many contexts, getting the process right is key to any successful change initiative. I am committed to clear communication and a collaborative, transparent process that utilizes our appointed and elected committees, such as Faculty Council, Staff Council, the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation and the Student Government Association. Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration Mike Howard and I have been and will continue meeting regularly with students, staff and faculty, in leadership groups and at large. Further, as noted in my recent letter, I invite each of you to write to me and my Cabinet at financialsustainability@smith.edu with your questions, concerns and suggestions.

In addition to the external financial challenges we have been discussing—e.g., projections for lower endowment earnings, the imperative to contain college costs, the new tax on endowment earnings—it is important to acknowledge the internal considerations that also inform our financial sustainability initiative. For example, we are committed to access, which means we will continue to provide significant student financial aid. We are committed to maintaining our low student-faculty ratio in order to provide the individualized, transformative education for which Smith is known. We are committed to making significant, urgent information technology investments to ensure we are providing the best available tools to support our academic and administrative work. We are committed to funding the initiatives in the strategic plan. And we are committed to balancing our budget every year.

One of the ways we will address these external and internal factors will be to reorganize our work processes and structures to become more efficient. By removing barriers to productivity, we will be able to focus more of our resources on the activities at the core of our educational mission. Currently, members of my Cabinet are working on significant proposals to make the college more cost-effective and more strategically focused. At the same time, we are finalizing a multiyear IT transformation plan. Staff members across the college will play a role in these process and technology changes.

In the course of restructuring our work, some jobs will change, some jobs will be eliminated, and some jobs will be created. It is never easy for a community when a job is eliminated. I want to assure you that we will support affected colleagues to the best of our ability during their transition, for example with job placement assistance. As with everything we do, these changes will be approached with care.

I have received questions on the following topics:

Staff salaries
Decisions about staff  raises are made year to year in the context of a number of factors, including job performance, inflation, market trends, and the college’s budgetary constraints. While no decisions have been made at this time regarding raises for FY19, we remain strongly committed to offering competitive compensation and benefits for our employees.

Supporting staff
If a position is eliminated, Human Resources will make efforts to place the affected staff member elsewhere at the college. If this is not possible, staff will be eligible for severance pay and other assistance as reflected in our policies.

Financial markets
Although financial markets are currently performing well, analysts predict that long-term endowment returns will be lower in the future. Some of you may have seen the recent NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments, which noted that “Despite this year’s improved return, the mission-critical 10-year average annual return fell to 4.6 percent from last year’s 5.0 percent.” If our future endowment returns over the medium and long term are lower, we won’t be able to increase the amount we draw from the endowment over the current level.

The endowment excise tax
The precise impact of the new endowment income excise tax is not clear at this moment. While we know that the excise tax on endowment income went into effect January 1, 2018, the Treasury Department has yet to issue guidance on terms or definitions used to put the ruling into practice.

We are a vibrant and resilient community and I know we will remain so as we make needed changes. The best way to maintain the strength of our community as we make difficult choices is to act with openness, respect and compassion. While it can be challenging to reexamine our work processes and structures, we will continue to celebrate our successes and create moments to be with one another in community.

Thank you for your questions, which I will continue to answer, online and in person. And thank you for your insights and ongoing partnership.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

Dear students,

I am writing with two important updates about our sustained work on inclusion, diversity and equity.

First, we begin the spring semester with a terrific new member of the Smith College Cabinet on board: David Carreon Bradley, vice president for inclusion, diversity and equity. Many of you met Vice President Carreon Bradley during the search process last fall, and I am grateful for your help in bringing him to Smith. You are all invited to a reception I am hosting from 4:30 to 6 p.m. on Thursday, February 1, at the Alumnae House, to welcome him as he joins our community. I look forward to seeing you there.

Second, members of the Cabinet are using the results of the Pathways Campus Climate Survey to guide new and expanded initiatives. For example:

The vice president for enrollment and her staff are evaluating outcomes of financial aid awards to ensure that students eligible for financial aid have the same opportunities as our student population at large to enjoy all elements of the Smith experience, for example study abroad and research opportunities.
	The dean of students has formed a task force on belonging and loneliness to address some of the concerns raised by students in the survey. Students, staff and faculty are serving on this committee.
	The provost and the vice president for information technology are collaborating on an open textbook initiative, with the library and educational technology team, to ensure that all students have equitable access to curricular materials and textbooks. In addition, the Committee on Educational Technology is exploring ways to increase students’ access to technology devices for use in and out of the classroom.
	The vice president for information technology has set up a platform, Namecoach, to help faculty and staff learn to pronounce students’ names.
	The provost is working with faculty to recruit an exceptional cohort of scholar-teachers from underrepresented groups, using regular searches as well as targeted senior faculty searches.
	Smith is enhancing professional development offered by the provost and dean of the faculty’s office through the college’s institutional membership in the National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity.
	The Sherrerd Center for Teaching and Learning is dedicating its year of faculty programming to developing and supporting more inclusive classrooms.
	The dean of the college and her staff are working with the JED Foundation to assess and strengthen our mental health programs and services.
	Vice President Carreon Bradley will be collaborating with the provost to host faculty and staff of color socials each semester, to build community.Our most important, sustained goal is to continue our progress toward building an inclusive, diverse and equitable Smith College. I look forward to your insights and partnership as we move forward.

65,"Impact of Proposed Tax Bill on Smith College and Higher Education                  ","          
    
          November 8, 2017

Dear students, staff, faculty and alumnae:

I write to alert you to legislation moving quickly in Congress that could have significant implications for Smith College, students and their families—affecting the affordability of and access to higher education nationwide.

The proposed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R.1) recently introduced in the House of Representatives contains a number of provisions that will adversely affect students and educational institutions, like Smith, whose missions are significantly supported by endowment income and whose students come from families spanning the income spectrum.

Provisions in the bill are estimated to cumulatively increase students’ college costs by more than $65 billion between 2018 and 2027. These measures are strongly opposed by many in the higher education community, including the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU) and the American Council on Education (ACE).

Two elements of the bill are particularly concerning.

First, the bill would tax income on university and college endowment earnings, a mandate that would reduce Smith’s overall funding and limit our ability to allocate funds where they are most needed.

At Smith, income from the endowment generates a critical funding stream—fully one-third of the operating budget— that allows the college to provide financial aid to students with need, shape the composition of the faculty to meet curricular objectives, develop new initiatives, keep pace with technological change and offer programs that benefit society at large. Smith students and their parents, regardless of income or assets, pay less than the true cost of a Smith education because of subsidies from the endowment.

If endowment income is taxed, a Smith education would likely become more expensive, which could make it inaccessible for some, altering the diverse makeup of our student body, and potentially reduce the overall quality of education. Specifically, the proposed 1.4 percent tax on endowment income could represent a $1.2 million negative impact on Smith’s annual operating budget. To put that figure in context, it represents the equivalent of financial aid for 30 students every year, based on Smith’s average institutional aid award of $39,000.

Second, the bill directly targets those with student loans, proposing to repeal the loan interest deduction. Currently, alumnae with a modified adjusted gross income of less than $80,000 ($165,000 if married filing jointly) can deduct as much as $2,500 of student loan interest from their taxes every year. H.R. 1 would remove this deduction, an important support currently used by three in 10 Americans paying off student loans.

The House bill is the first step in a legislative process that is moving very quickly. Similar action is expected soon by the Senate Finance Committee. Given our shared commitment to education access, I hope you will join me in making your concerns known. Resources and background are available on the Smith website.

If enacted, this bill has the potential to undermine college affordability and jeopardize the future of private and public colleges. In turn, this could have a negative impact on employment and the economy. I thank you in advance for raising your voice and fighting to preserve the values of access and excellence on which Smith College was founded.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

I am writing in response to an incident on Otelia Cromwell Day, brought to my attention by a student group advocating for affinity housing. The students recounted the use of racially charged language by a staff member.

When I spoke with representatives of this student group, they rightfully stressed the importance of holding members of the Smith community accountable for “careless language.” Racially charged language is not appropriate on any day; the fact that this event happened on Otelia Cromwell Day, a day that honors inclusion, diversity and equity, is especially egregious and painful. The college is following up with all parties involved.

We must and will strengthen our education and training to build a more just community at Smith. I am grateful to the students for their advocacy; it is crucial we each take the responsibility to identify and address incidents like this one.

<U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

In recent weeks, individuals around the world have shared their experiences of sexual harassment and violence in an effort to draw public attention to the scale of sexual predation. Their stories, some dating from decades past, have united and empowered survivors of all ages.

At Smith College, we take seriously our obligation to maintain an environment that is free of sexual and gender-based harassment and violence. Such conduct interferes with the security, well-being and professional climate of our community. It impedes academic success as well as access to educational and employment opportunities.

Faculty are prohibited from having sexual relationships and/or romantic involvement with students per the Policy on Sexual Relationships Between Faculty and Students. Staff are prohibited from having sexual relationships and/or romantic involvement with students per the Gender-Based and Sexual Misconduct Policy. These prohibitions apply regardless of the age of the student and regardless of consent.

To report sexual harassment, sexual violence or other sexual misconduct, past or present, I encourage you to reach out to the following resources: Smith’s Title IX coordinator and deputy coordinators; the Counseling Service (students); or the college’s employee assistance program, offered through e4health, 800-828-6025 (staff or faculty). You may also contact Campus Police or the Northampton Police.

In closing, I want to emphasize how seriously I take these issues, both personally and professionally. Sexual misconduct has no place at Smith College.

Sincerely,

Thank you to everyone who made our NEASC (New England Association of Schools and Colleges) team visit a great success. I appreciate the many ways students, staff and faculty contributed to and engaged with our accreditation process over the past three days, as well as with our planning process over the past two years.

As is NEASC custom, the visit culminated in a report from the visiting team chair, Christina Paxson, president of Brown University. She offered a preliminary assessment of our institutional strengths and recommended areas of focus as we move forward.

While we can expect more detail once the team submits their written evaluation, President Paxson’s report commended the Smith community for our strong and shared commitment to our mission as a women’s college. She also credited Smith with strength in the following areas:

Our culture of strategic planning, including the alignment of academic and operational priorities
	Our well-functioning system of governance at all levels, including the board of trustees and campus committees
	Our culture of data-informed assessment, notably through the Committee on Academic Priorities’ (CAP’s) focus on evidence-based learning outcomes
	Our progress in admissions, including growth in applications in recent years as well as our progress toward being increasingly diverse, less need-conscious and more selective
	Our financial strength as well as our proactive planning to mitigate growing economic pressures on higher education
The team also recommended that Smith devote attention to the following areas:

Advancing information technology capability to improve data-informed decision making
	Reviewing the role of graduate education in the context of our overall mission
	Continuing to advance our commitment to inclusion, diversity and equity
We will receive formal notification of our reaccreditation status next April and can anticipate that NEASC will ask us to present evidence of improvement in these areas when we submit our required interim progress report(s) to them.

I am pleased and proud of this outcome, and grateful for everyone’s contributions in making Smith a strong and vibrant academic community.

          October 23, 2017

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

In December 2015, the Smith College Board of Trustees appointed a group of trustees, faculty, staff and students to a re-constituted body known as the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility (ACIR). The role of ACIR is to “consult with the Investment Committee on social issues relevant to investing and thereby ensure the endowment continues to be invested in a manner consistent with—and supportive of—the college's mission and values.""

To establish a foundation for its work, ACIR drafted principles for socially responsible investing and shared them with the Smith community for review and comment. Those principles were approved by the board of trustees in May 2017. In parallel, ACIR began deliberations on its first substantive matter: the role of Smith’s endowment in the college’s climate-action goals.

As we affirmed in our March 6, 2017, letter, “[c]limate change is an urgent, complex problem. Human activities are pushing the climate beyond the range of conditions experienced over the last few million years and toward abrupt, unpredictable, highly damaging and potentially irreversible impacts.”

The recent report of the collegewide Study Group on Climate Change (SGCC) advised that Smith’s response to climate change be “comprehensive” and set “clear pathways for climate action in the college’s educational mission, operations and finances...” SGCC’s recommendations, developed over the course of a year of study and consultation, identified five major areas in which Smith could take action, including in its investments. SGCC’s endowment-related recommendations, as well as the advocacy of Divest Smith College and the Student Government Association, strongly informed ACIR’s deliberations.

We are pleased to inform you that, at its October 21 meeting, the Smith College Board of Trustees adopted ACIR’s four strategic recommendations regarding climate change and the Smith endowment. As context for these recommendations, it should be noted that the Smith endowment is managed by Investure LLC, the college’s outsourced investment office. Investure’s activities are overseen by the Investment Committee of the board of trustees.

Recommendation 1: Increase impact investing
First, and most significantly, Smith will increase its impact investments—those intended to generate measurable social and environmental change alongside a financial return—from $9.5 million to $30 million, over time. Examples of such investments might be industries and funds focused on sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, energy efficiency, conservation, affordable and accessible services and sustainable manufacturing processes. The Investment Committee has asked Investure to identify such investments. This enhanced commitment to impact investing aligns with values of innovation and social change at the center of the Smith experience.

Recommendation 2: Favor managers and funds adhering to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles
As of June 30, 2017, 16 percent of Smith’s endowment is invested directly or indirectly in funds with ESG policies via 23 fund managers. The board voted to have the Investment Committee work with Investure to continue to increase the number of funds and fund managers in the endowment who have adopted ESG principles. This decision reflects the recognition that this type of investing can support the college’s broader commitments to environmental sustainability and social equity while still generating appropriate financial return.

Recommendation 3: Avoid future direct holdings in coal
As of June 30, 2017, Smith’s endowment does not have any direct coal holdings. Recognizing that coal is the most environmentally harmful fossil fuel, the board voted to avoid any future direct investments in coal. The Investment Committee will work with Investure to exclude from the endowment any new direct investments in coal that would be directly owned by Smith or held directly by Investure funds.

Recommendation 4: Report regularly on socially responsible investment progress
The Investment Committee of the board will work with Investure to provide regular, transparent reports to the Smith community on such metrics as fossil fuel exposure, ESG adoption and impact investments. ACIR will receive and review such reports on a quarterly basis.

For more information on these recommendations and on socially responsible investing at Smith, see the Frequently Asked Questions page.

We are proud of the advocacy and deliberative process the members of our community undertook to reach this milestone in further aligning Smith’s endowment with its mission and values. We thank the members of ACIR for their sustained work and thoughtful, deeply researched recommendations. Taken collectively, these actions send a clear signal of Smith’s strong and ongoing interest in environmentally responsible investing—and investment options—in support of its enduring mission: educating women of promise for lives of distinction and purpose.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney

I am grateful to Donna for the many ways she strengthened Smith College. She launched a visionary women’s leadership program, funded by a $10 million gift. She revitalized athletics, recruiting an outstanding new director and raising the profile of the Smith Pioneers. Under her leadership, graduation and retention rates have been notably improved. I will miss Donna’s insightful counsel and her commitment to student development and the student experience.

I have asked Susan Etheredge ’77, professor of education and child study and a longtime member of the Smith community, to serve as interim dean of the college and vice president for campus life. One of the early recipients of the Sherrerd Prize for Distinguished Teaching, Susan was the associate dean of faculty, the inaugural director of our first-year seminar program, and a director of our JYA program in Florence, Italy. She has served on nearly every major leadership committee of the college, including Faculty Council, the Committee on Academic Policy and the Committee on Mission and Priorities.

Susan will fulfill her teaching duties through the end of this semester while spending some time each week focused on her new position. Donna has generously offered to help onboard Susan and to ensure a smooth transition in all of the Dean’s program areas.

<U+200B><U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

I am pleased to share with you our self-study report, submitted to the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). This document is the product of a collaborative process undertaken over the past two years that involved students, faculty, staff and trustees in drafting the narrative and reviewing data. It provides the basis for the NEASC external team visit on October 29–November 1, 2017.

The title of the self study—Sustainable Change to Educate Exceptional Women Leaders and Global Citizens—is appropriate to this moment in our history. As you will see, our self-study is both an assessment of Smith today and a statement of our future aspirations.

You can read and review the self-study here with your Smith login.

I look forward to sharing the Smith story with our visiting team when they arrive on campus later this fall.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

<U+200B><U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

As mentioned in my September 6 campus letter, I am pleased to announce that, for the second year, I will be offering the Innovation Challenge Program on “Advancing Inclusion, Diversity and Equity.” This competitive funding opportunity will support innovative projects that strengthen our community.

I invite all current students, staff and faculty—individually or in groups—to propose innovative projects for funding consideration. In light of responses to the Pathways Campus Climate Survey, I am especially interested in funding ideas to advance inclusion and belonging in student houses. Last year’s funded projects included training for workers helping local refugees, an interactive leadership development program, retreats focused on navigating implicit bias, and more.

Proposals will be due October 13. Proposal guidelines and a submission form can be found at www.smith.edu/innovation-challenge. In addition, an information session will be held on Tuesday, September 19, from 4 to 5 p.m. in Campus Center 204.

As you develop your proposals, please consider the following:

Projects should demonstrate innovative approaches to teaching, research and activism related to inclusion and anti-racism efforts.
	Proposals that take a team approach and engage students, staff and faculty in collaborative projects are particularly encouraged.
	Projects should focus on culture change/enhancement, and especially on ideas that can be replicated at a larger scale.
	Projects selected for funding must be completed during the timeframe that the primary applicant is at Smith (e.g., a graduating senior may not undertake a project that extends beyond her graduation). Semester-long or calendar year projects will be prioritized.
	Projects that are eligible for funding from other college sources will not be considered.
	Funds may not be used to pay Smith students, staff or faculty.
	Projects that are currently being funded (e.g., current faculty research, programs receiving student activities funding) will not be considered.
	Grants may range in size from $1,000 to $10,000.
A grants review committee, which includes students, staff and faculty, will make funding recommendations to me.

I look forward to supporting our community’s best ideas to advance inclusion, diversity and equity on our campus and in our community.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

<U+200B><U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

For the past several years, I have begun the fall semester with an update on our shared, sustained commitment to inclusion, diversity, equity and access. The recent hateful actions of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, as well as the ending of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), make this commitment even more urgent and more central to our mission and institutional values. This letter highlights opportunities to educate ourselves, in our roles as teachers, scholars and learners, to recognize and oppose racism and other forms of hatred and bias and to foster communities based on justice and respect.

Vice President for Inclusion, Diversity and Equity search
We are at the beginning stages of the search for a new vice president for inclusion, diversity and equity. I am grateful to the following members of our community who have agreed to serve on that search committee: Provost and Dean of the Faculty Katherine Rowe, chair; Trustee Neelum Amin; Professor Floyd Cheung; Associate Vice President for Human Resources Larry Hunt; Natalie James ’18; Professor Nnamdi Pole; Associate Dean of the College Danielle Ramdath; Director of Disability Services Laura Rauscher; and Trustee Mona Sinha. They will be assisted in their work by the firm of Spelman and Johnson. We will announce several open forums for members of our community to share ideas about the qualities and experience important for success in this role. The first open forum, for students, will take place at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, September 19, in the Carroll Room, Campus Center.

Programs
This fall, the Office of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity and the Sherrerd Center for Teaching and Learning are partnering on a campaign to encourage all members of our community to help improve campus climate. They will be offering practical strategies for strengthening our community in positive ways. One such strategy is to develop community habits of “micro-affirmation” to systemically counter implicit bias—small, concrete actions done to support others and help them succeed.

Our alumnae will offer programming as well. Over the course of the year, “Diverse Smithies: Connecting, Coaching, and Celebrating Together,” a project coordinated by the Office of Alumnae Relations, will bring alumnae of color to campus to offer a series of workshops for students on such topics as addressing implicit bias, using one’s authentic voice for change and building inclusive and just communities. The goal of the project is two-fold: to build skills and to foster connections among diverse Smithies across the generations.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Students’ Alliance (BSA) at Smith. BSA President Natalie James ’18 and Co-President Gelonnie Smith ’18 will be announcing a series of events, including opportunities for students to connect with alumnae.

Speakers
On November 2, we will welcome writer, professor and commentator Roxane Gay as the Otelia Cromwell Day keynote speaker. The author of the essay collection Bad Feminist and the memoir Hunger, among other works, Gay will address the 2017 Otelia Cromwell Day theme ""Resist. Act. Persevere.”

On December 5, as part of its 20th anniversary series, the Poetry Center will host a reading by Afaa Michael Weaver, described by Henry Louis Gates as “one of the most significant poets writing today.” The son of a sharecropper, Weaver grew up in working class Baltimore to become the author of fifteen books of poems and the recipient of numerous awards. His acclaimed “Plum Flower Trilogy” tells of his search for cultural and racial identity.

On April 13, 2018, in conjunction with the Office of Alumnae Relations’ Women of Color Conference, I will host a presidential colloquium address by Juana Maria Rodriguez, professor of gender and women's studies at the University of California Berkeley and author of two books, Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces and Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures and Other Latina Longings.

Initiatives in our centers
The Jandon Center, along with the Lewis Global Studies Center, is serving as the lead office for volunteer work relating to refugee families arriving in Northampton.

The Sherrerd Center for Teaching and Learning is focusing its programming on creating inclusive learning environments. Guest speakers will present on topics such as culturally responsive teaching in STEM and lessons from cognitive science about effective teaching. Sherrerd staff will also be working with the Classroom Committee on a survey to inform the renovation of our classrooms for more inclusive pedagogy.

The Wurtele Center is expanding its advising and support work with first-gen students, including an initiative in which students produce digital narratives of their academic and personal successes.

The Mwangi Cultural Center will soon be hosting its programs in renovated space, thanks to improvements over the summer designed to make it more flexible and effective for group gatherings.

2017–18 President’s Innovation Challenge
For the second year, I will be offering grants to fund innovative projects that promote inclusion and strengthen our community. Proposals can come from students, staff and faculty, individually or in groups. In light of responses to the Pathways Campus Climate Survey, I am especially interested in funding ideas to advance inclusion and belonging in student houses. Please see last year’s funded projects for ideas and look for a formal call for proposals soon. The Innovation Challenge reflects my strong belief in supporting the wisdom, creativity and activism of this community; I hope many of you will apply.

I wish each of you a successful and fulfilling year. I look forward to seeing you tonight at Convocation.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          September 5, 2017

Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

This morning, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on behalf of the Trump administration the end of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a policy enacted under President Obama that enables undocumented immigrants, brought to the U.S. as children, to pursue education and employment. The President’s decision is antithetical to Smith College’s commitment to access and opportunity as well as a threat to valued members of our community and to hundreds of thousands of people across the country.

My immediate priority is to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our students, regardless of immigration status. Dean of the College Donna Lisker and her staff are available to our DACA and undocumented students to reassure them of our unwavering support and to connect them with legal counsel, funded by the college. We will stand with our students during these difficult times.

The President said he will delay enforcement of his decision for six months, to allow time for Congress to act on possible replacements for DACA. In the meantime, our policies to protect all members of our community remain firmly in place. Key among those commitments are the facts that Smith will:

Take no voluntary action that would put members of our community at risk because of their citizenship or immigration status.
Resist releasing information about students’ citizenship or immigration status unless we are legally compelled to do so; if presented with a subpoena or other imperative, we will seek legal counsel before taking any steps to comply.DACA was created and rescinded by executive order; the possibility of a Congressional solution is very much alive. One legislative effort in this area is the Bar Removal of Individuals who Dream and Grow our Economy or BRIDGE Act, a bipartisan bill introduced in July by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Durbin (D-IL). A companion bill in the House, introduced by U.S. Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), and Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), would, similarly, give many of those previously covered under DACA a pathway to citizenship. Some of us may choose to press our legislators to enact these DACA-like protections. In addition, some of us may choose to support nonprofits such as the National Immigration Law Center.

In this time of uncertainty for students and families, we must continue to actively care for one another. We must support every student in pursuing an education in an environment of safety and stability. We are a strong and caring community, and we will continue to live our values every day.

Sincerely,

Kathleen McCartney
President

          August 14, 2017

<U+200B>Dear Students, Staff and Faculty:

Like millions of people throughout the world, I was shocked and saddened by the actions of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend. Their racist and anti-Semitic acts of intimidation and domestic terrorism are deplorable to all people of good will and conscience.

I join so many others in standing with the University of Virginia and the citizens of Charlottesville. As Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer said, “The nation is speaking with one voice about what they saw here and what needs to happen next.”

We, the Smith community, reaffirm our unequivocal commitments to diversity, inclusion, equity, and the dignity and worth of all people. Free speech is at the core of our educational enterprise, and we will never tolerate hate speech that incites violence.

Values like these draw white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups to demonstrate in college and university towns. As the Southern Poverty Law Center has written, “College campuses are clearly on the frontline of the alt-right’s battle against multiculturalism...[Campuses] are home to the highest ideals of human rights.” I pledge to each of you my full and unwavering commitment to your freedom to study, teach, work and live at Smith College in a climate of safety and respect.

We are a remarkable community, a resilient community, and a community united against hate. At a time of darkness, sadness and confusion, we draw on these strengths. As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., taught, “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.” Let us raise our voices together, now more than ever.

Kathleen McCartney
President
